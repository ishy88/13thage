			"Energy seethes in the Chaos, in the hearts of dragons, behind the dependable cycle of the seasons, and amid the unbridled fury of the storm’s heart. This energy imprints my very blood!."

		<p>
			<b>Overview</b>: When the Empire was young, there were no sorcerers. Today, it seems they’re everywhere. In the earliest ages, each icon held dominion over their own magic power. Only servants of the Archmage, for example, could use an Archmage’s arcane secrets. But that time was many ages ago, and things are different now. Age by age, arcane and divine power has slipped from the icons’ hands into the spells of mortals who control it as best they can ... or simply let fly. Sorcerers are notoriously reckless with their spells. Wizards say that a sorcerer doesn’t so much cast a spell as uncork it. Elves say you never talk to the same sorcerer twice, and dwarves say not even once.<br/>
			&emsp;Magic pulses through your veins, calling on you to give it expression. As it grows ever stronger, will it consume you or transform you into magic incarnate?<br/>
			<b>Play Style</b>: Sorcerers are self-taught genius freaks with an intuitive mastery of magic and possibly some brain damage. They tap into the icons’ power with or without the icons’ permission. Some are aligned with an icon, such as the lickspittle eunuch slaves of the Three, trained since before birth to be dragon sorcerers. Some are outlaws, such as a secret cult devoted to occult rituals, including initiation ceremonies that grant deathless and infernal power. Some sorcerers are simply one-off flukes resulting from astrological mismatches, early exposure to otherworldly forces, and other supernatural happenstance.<br/>
			&emsp;Since sorcerers are so variable, players should personalize their sorcerers freely. Change the names and fiction for your character’s powers. Adjust the details of your powers to make them fit your character's fiction better. If your sorcerer was cursed at birth to wield the power of the Lich King, maybe your breath of the white dragon spell is called breath of the grave. Now instead of looking like a blast of ice, the breath weapon effect looks like creepy fog that freezes everything, accompanied by the sound of your own death rattle. Same effect, unique fiction.<br/>
			&emsp;A sorcerer isn’t the simplest class to play, but choosing whether you want to gather power or cast something right now isn’t all that tough. Players who can handle dice swinginess may enjoy the sorcerer more. If you’re not that type, steer clear of the more chaotic powers.<br/>
			<b>Backgrounds</b>: Here are a few sorcerer backgrounds to get you started: tribal shaman, former child avatar, pirate captain, spell-arena gladiator, failed wizard, Shadow Port city guard, sahuagin hunter.

			<h5>Class Features</h5>

			<p class="initial">All sorcerers share three general class features: Access to Wizardry, Dancing Lights, and Gather Power. Breath weapon, chain, and random energy are keywords used in sorcerer spells</p>

			<h7>Access to Wizardry</h7>
			<p>Starting at 3rd level, you can take a wizard spell in place of a sorcerer spell. The wizard spell must be two levels lower than the sorcerer spell.</p>

			<h7>Breath Weapon</h7>
			<p>Spells with the breath weapon keyword have a chance to be re-used during battle. Each breath weapon spell lists the chance of re-using it (usually 16+). At the start of each round after you’ve cast the breath weapon spell, make the re-use roll. Success indicates that you may re-use that spell as a standard action, but for that round only. If you fail the re-use roll, you don’t have the option to re-use the spell, but you get another chance at the beginning of the next round. The breath weapon power lasts for a single battle only. You can have only one breath weapon spell active at a time. If you cast a different breath weapon spell when you have an earlier spell active, the new spell cancels the earlier spell. (See the Chromatic Destroyer Heritage talent for the path to multiple breath weapon spells.) Failing a death save cancels any breath weapon spells you have active.</p>

			<h7>Chain</h7>
			<p>When you attack with a chain spell and get a natural even roll, you can roll another attack against a different enemy within range. Keep on rolling attacks as long as you get even rolls and don’t run out of new targets. Each enemy can be targeted only once.</p>

			<h7>Dancing Lights</h7>
			<p>All sorcerers can cast the dancing lights spell as a standard action. Unlike the wizard’s light cantrip, the sorcerer’s dancing lights spell produces a number of varicolored light globes that bloom within 5 to 30 feet of the sorcerer every two to five seconds. The sorcerer has very little control over the exact location or illumination provided by the lights, meaning that they can occasionally be used for dramatic plot purposes.</p>

			<h7>Gather Power</h7>
			<p>Once initiative has been rolled and a battle is underway, a sorcerer can spend a standard action to gather magical power, preparing themselves for casting a double-strength spell with their next standard action. Gathering power is loud and very noticeable. Sorcerers who want to gather power before initiative has been rolled can go through the motions but won’t get any benefit from the act. When a sorcerer gathers power, it does not count as casting a spell; you can gather power without taking opportunity attacks.<br/>
			&emsp;In addition, because you spend your standard action to gather power, you generate a small magical benefit. Like many of your powers, this benefit is chaotic rather than perfectly reliable, so you must make a random check to see what benefit you get. Roll a d6 and consult the appropriate table below. If you get a benefit that deals damage to enemies, you can choose the type of damage (cold, fire, lightning, or thunder).</p>

			<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" style="text-align: center">

			</table>
			<p>After you have gathered power, you can use your next standard action to cast an empowered sorcerer spell. Empowered sorcerer spells deal double the damage of a normal sorcerer spell. This means that you double the damage results of the hit or a miss from the single spell. Non-attack spells generally don’t improve when cast empowered; use empowered casting for attacks. If you do not or are not able to use your next standard action to cast a sorcerer attack spell, you lose the power you’ve gathered. You can use another standard action to gather power again, but the spell you eventually cast will still only do double damage.<br/>
			&emsp;You can spend your move actions and quick actions any way you like after you gather power and before casting your next empowered spell. Yes, once a battle has started it’s possible to perform the magical firefight trick of gathering power while hiding to the side of the cave entrance, then jumping into the cave opening on your next turn and blasting with the empowered spell.<br/>
			&emsp;Breath weapon spells add an extra wrinkle. Of course you can gather power the first time you cast a breath weapon spell in a battle. Later in the fight it’s a question of whether you gathered power the turn before a breath weapon spell roll goes your way. You can be all ready with gathered power but roll too low to use the breath weapon spell, forcing you to cast a different spell with the gathered power. If you’ve gathered power for a spell that deals ongoing damage, the ongoing damage is doubled the first time it is dealt, but not on subsequent rounds, if any.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Once per battle, you can choose the chaotic benefit you want instead of rolling for it.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Once per battle when the escalation die is 4+, you can gather power as a quick action.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: When you gather power, if the escalation die is 2+, you can roll two chaotic benefits. Unlike most effects, the benefits stack if you roll the same result twice.</p>

			<h7>Random Energy</h7>
			<p>Some sorcerer spells deal damage of a random type. If it matters for the situation, use a d4 to determine which type of damage the spell deals.</p>

			<h5>Class Talents</h5>

			<p class="initial"><i>About Heritage Talents</i>: Sorcerers possess innate talent for magic that is impulsive and chaotic where wizardry is measured and studied. Most sorcerers have strong magical links to one of the icons.</p>

			<h7>Arcane Heritage</h7>
			<p>Although magic is in the blood of every sorcerer, you have a greater understanding of magic than most sorcerers and even some wizards. You gain a +2 bonus to a background that involves or suggests magical knowledge or talent, up to your normal maximum background point limit. You can also use one of your sorcerer spell choices to choose any wizard spell of the same level. You get only one such equal-level wizard spell at a time; all others have to be purchased using the 2-level penalty in the Access to Wizardry class feature described above.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: You can cast your wizard spells empowered as if they were sorcerer powers. Generally, empowering wizard spells only helps by doubling the damage.</p>

			<h7>Blood Link</h7>
			<p>You gain one relationship point with each icon that you share a heritage with; you choose whether the point is positive, conflicted, or negative. You are not limited by relationship maximums with these points.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: You gain a second relationship point with each icon that you share a heritage with. You are not limited by relationship maximums with these points.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: You gain a third relationship point with each icon that you share a heritage with. You are not limited by relationship maximums with these points.</p>

			<h7>Chromatic Destroyer Heritage</h7>
			<p>You can have multiple breath weapon spells active at the same time. You don’t gain extra actions, so if you succeed with multiple breath weapon spells, you’ll generally have to choose which one to use.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You gain a +1 attack bonus for each breath weapon spell that you have active.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Whenever one succeed on a roll to reuse a breath weapon spell, your critical hit range expands by 2 until the start of your next turn. This bonus is cumulative.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Choose one breath weapon spell you know. You may use it twice per day.</p>

			<h7>Fey Heritage</h7>
			<p>One battle per day, when you roll initiative, you can choose to invoke your Fey Heritage and gain the racial power of one the elven races in addition to your own racial power. Roll on the table below. If you roll your own race’s power, you gain an additional use of that power this battle.</p>

			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You can now invoke your Fey Heritage talent in two battles each day.</p>

			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Once per battle when the escalation die reaches 6+, as a free action, you can gain an elf racial power that you have not already used in this battle.</p>

			<h7>Infernal Heritage</h7>
			<p>Once per day, as a quick action when the escalation die is 1+, you can enter a spell frenzy until the end of the battle. While in a spell frenzy, you roll 2d20 for each of your sorcerer spell attacks. Use the highest die as your attack roll, but track whether the other die hits. For each die that misses, you take damage equal to double your level.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You gain resist energy damage 12+ to fire and to one of the following types of energy of your choice: acid, cold, lightning, psychic, thunder.</p>

			<h7>Sorcerer’s Familiar</h7>
			<p>You have a familiar much like a wizard’s familiar, but more changeable. Unlike the wizard, you don’t choose two abilities for your familiar. Instead you choose one permanent ability that suits your familiar’s nature; the only limitation is that you can’t choose tough as the permanent ability.
