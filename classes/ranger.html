			<b>Overview</b>: Rangers are watchful warriors who roam past the horizon to safeguard a region, a principle, or a way of life. Masters of bow and blade, rangers excel at hit-and-run assaults and can quickly and silently eliminate foes. Rangers lay superb ambushes and excel at avoiding danger.<br/>
			&emsp;As a ranger, you possess almost supernaturally keen senses and a deep appreciation for untamed wilderness. With your knowledge of the natural world, you are able to track enemies through nearly any landscape, using the smallest clue to set your course, even sometimes the calls and songs of beasts and birds. Your severe demeanor promises a deadly conclusion to any enemy you hunt.<br/>
			&emsp;When you catch sight of your quarry, will the transgressor perish by swift bow shots from a distance, or  by the twofold blades that glint and glitter in each of your battle-scarred hands?
			<b>Play Style</b>: Like the barbarian, the ranger is simple to play. Your choices in play come from your class talents since you don’t choose new attacks or spells as you gain levels. Most every attack you make uses your basic melee or ranged attack.<br/>
			&emsp;Choosing to have an animal companion complicates matters slightly, since you’ll have two creatures to act with each turn: your ranger and the animal you choose.<br/>
			&emsp;If you want to have an animal by your side that has less impact on battles and that requires fewer decisions in play, choose the Ranger’s Pet talent instead of the Animal Companion talent.<br/>
			<b>Backgrounds</b>: Possible backgrounds include: tracker, bounty hunter, beast slayer, woodsy assassin, orc slayer, and wanderer.

		<div id="class-features" class="tabcontent" style="display: block">
			<h5>Class Features</h5>
			<p class=initial>At first level, you may select one of the following combat styles.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Two-Handed</b>: You gain Two-Handed Mastery and Double Melee Attack as bonus talents.</li>
				<li><b>Archery</b>: You gain Archery and Double Ranged Attack as bonus talents.</li>
				<li><b>Companion</b>: You gain Animal Companion at adept level as a bonus talent.</li>
			</ul>

			<h5>Class Talents</h5>

			<p class="initial">Choose three of the following class talents. You get an additional ranger class talent at 5th level, and again at 8th level.</p>

			<h7>Animal Companion</h7>
			<p>You have a devoted animal companion who fights alongside you like a member of your adventuring party. If you have a single talent invested into Animal Companion, you are an Animal Companion initiate. If you invested two talents into Animal Companion, you are an Animal Companion adept.</p>
			<div class="indent">
				<p><b>Calling to Battle</b>: When you roll initiative, you may choose whether you want your animal companion to take part in the battle. You may also call your animal companion during the battle with a quick action. Animal Companion initiates may only call their animal companion once every other battle. The animal companion may not fight in two battles in a row—even between full heal-ups, adventures, or gaining new levels. Animal Companion adepts don’t have this limitation; their animal companion can fight in every battle if the adept so chooses.</p>
				<p><b>Recoveries</b>: Your animal companion doesn't have any recoveries, it uses yours instead.</p>
				<p><b>Actions</b>: Your animal companion acts on your initiative turn, either immediately before or after you, depending on the animal type. Your animal companion moves gets a move action and a standard action, but not a quick action. If you have powers that care about the “first time you attack an enemy,” an attack by your animal companion counts as your attack. Your animal companion adds the escalation die to its attack rolls.</p>
				<p><b>Animal Harm</b>: Your animal companion can be healed like an ally. If it gets to heal using a recovery, it uses one of your recoveries. Instead of dying like a monster or NPC at 0 hp, your animal companion follows PC rules for falling unconscious at 0 hp and dying after four failed death saves or when its negative hit points equal half its normal hit points. If your animal companion dies, it’s gone for the battle, though you can call it (or another one) to fight in the next battle (as an adept) or the in the battle after that (as an initiate). That animal companion will be one level lower than an animal companion would normally be, i.e. one level below you. At the start of the next battle, bump the animal companion up to its proper level.</p>
				<p><b>Stats & Levels</b>: Your animal companion's level is equal to yours. Each animal companion has roughly the same base stats as listed below. On top of the base stats, each type of animal has a zoologically appropriate power or advantage.</p>
				<p><b>Companion Bonuses</b>: Each type of animal companion is a little different.</p>
				<div class="indent">
					<p>
						<b>Bear</b> (also Giant Badger, Wolverine)<br/>
						Acts: After ranger<br/>
						Advantage: The bear gains temporary hit points equal to its level each time it hits with an attack.<br/>
						<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: The temporary hit points increase to double its level.</p>
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Boar</b> (also Spiky Lizard)<br/>
						Acts: Before ranger<br/>
						Advantage: The boar gains a +1 attack bonus when it moves before its attack during the same turn.<br/>
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Eagle</b> (also Falcon, Hawk, Owl, Vulture)<br/>
						Acts: Before ranger<br/>
						Advantage: It flies! Its melee damage die is dropped by one size (d6 at level 1).<br/>
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Panther</b> (also Lion, Tiger)<br/>
						Acts: Before ranger<br/>
						Advantage: The panther’s crit range expands by 2 against enemies with lower initiative than you.<br/>
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Snake</b> (also Giant Spider, Poison Toad)<br/>
						Acts: After ranger<br/>
						Advantage: The snake also deals ongoing poison damage equal to twice your level on a natural attack roll of 18+.<br/>
						<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: The ongoing damage is three times your level instead.</p>
						<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: The ongoing damage is four times your level instead.</p>
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Wolf</b> (also Dog, Coyote, Hyena, Jackal)<br/>
						Acts: After ranger<br/>
						Advantage: The wolf gains a +1 attack bonus against enemies its master attacked the same turn, or against enemies engaged with its master.<br/>
					</p>
				</div>
				<p><b>Baseline Stats</b>: Use the following stats as the baseline for your animal companion. Generally your companion’s Physical Defense should be higher than its Mental Defense, but you could flip that if you have a good explanation.</p>

				<p><b>Animal Companion Feats</b>: Ranger animal companion feats are designed so that they do not build on each other. Unlike other feats, you don’t have to take animal companion feats progressively as long as you qualify for the correct tier.</p>

			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Once per battle, when the escalation die is 3 or higher, you may use Archery one additional time.</p>

			<h7>Double Melee Attack</h7>
			<p>When fighting with two one-handed melee weapons, your default option is to make a double melee attack. Your weapon damage die drops one notch, usually from d8s to d6s. If your first attack is a natural even roll (hit or miss), you can make a second attack as a free action. If you decide you don’t want to try for a double melee attack while fighting with two one-handed weapons, declare it before rolling your attack; the single attack will deal the normal damage dice instead of using reduced damage dice.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Your second attack gains a +2 attack bonus if it is against a different target.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Once per battle, use Double Melee Attack after an odd attack roll.</p>

			<p>When you attack with a ranged weapon that does not need to be reloaded, your default option is to make a double ranged attack. Your weapon damage die drops one notch, usually from d8s to d6s. If your first attack is a natural even roll (hit or miss), you can make a second attack as a free action. If you decide you don’t want to try for a double ranged attack when firing your bow or other ranged weapon, declare it before rolling your attack; the single attack will deal the normal damage dice instead of using reduced damage dice.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Your second attack gains a +2 attack bonus if it is against a different target.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Once per battle, you can use Double Ranged Attack after an odd attack roll.</p>

			<p>Choose one daily or recharge spell of your level or lower from the sorcerer class. You can cast this spell as if you were a sorcerer (though you can’t gather power).</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: You gain a sorcerer at-will spell of your choice that is your level or lower.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Choose another daily or recharge spell of your level or lower from the sorcerer class. You can cast this spell as if you were a sorcerer.</p>

			<h7>Lethal Hunter</h7>

			<p>You may add the escalation die to disengage checks and to your AC against opportunity attacks.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Whenever an enemy would attempt to intercept you, you may make a disengage check. On a success, you ignore the enemy’s attempt and continue your movement as normal.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: At the start of your turn, if the escalation die is odd, you gain an extra move action. Once per battle, when the escalation die is 6, you may gain an extra standard action on your turn.</p>

			<h7>Ranger ex Cathedral</h7>
			<p>Choose one daily or recharge spell of your level or lower from the cleric class. You can cast this spell as if you were a cleric.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You can cast the cleric class feature heal spell once per battle.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: You gain a cleric at-will spell of your choice that is your level or lower.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Choose another daily or recharge spell of your level or lower from the cleric class. You can cast this spell as if you were a cleric.</p>

			<h7>Ranger’s Pet</h7>
			<p>You have a small animal or beast that accompanies you on your adventures. Use the rules from the Wizard’s Familiar talent with the following differences: 1. The creature is your pet or friend instead of your familiar. 2. Your pet is fully natural rather than partially magical. 3. Your pet can end up with more abilities, if you choose.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Your pet gains a third ability.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Your pet gains a fourth ability.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Your pet gains a fifth ability.</p>

			<h7>Tracker</h7>
			<p>You have the Tracker background at its full possible bonus of +5, without having to spend your normal background points on it. You are an expert wilderness tracker, capable of reading clues from the environment that others can’t perceive. Tracking doesn’t work well, however, in heavily traveled urban environments. In addition, you have the terrain stunt power.</p>
			<p><b>Terrain stunt</b>: At the start of each battle in a non-urban environment, roll a d6. Any time after the escalation die reaches that number, you’ll be able to use a quick action to execute a terrain stunt. Normally you can only use terrain stunt once per battle, but circumstances, geography, or excellent planning may suggest that you can pull it off more than once. Terrain stunts are improvisational effects that play off your preternatural understanding of the wilderness and all the diverse forms of the natural world. Things like knocking a hornets nest no one had noticed onto your enemy’s head, maneuvering a foe onto a soggy patch of ground that slows them down, shooting the cap off a mushroom spore in a dungeon that erupts on your enemies, getting your enemy’s sword wedged into a stalactite, finding the tree branch that lets you vault up to attack the flying demon that thought it was out of axe range, and similar types of actions.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Your grasp of the way the world is put together increases; you now can use terrain stunt in urban environments.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: You can track as well in urban areas as you do in the wilderness.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: You can track flying creatures and creatures that normally wouldn’t be trackable, and there’s the possibility that even teleports give you a sense of direction.</p>
