		<p>
			<b>Overview</b>: Some people are born to fight. Others like giving orders. Put these
two types of people together and you’ve got a commander.<br/>
			Commanders are accomplished and competent battle leaders. They stand on the front line issuing commands and bolstering their allies while leading the battle with weapon in hand. Commanders know how to rally a team to win a fight.<br/>
			&emsp;The weight of your armor is not a hindrance; it is a familiar comfort. The worn weapon grip molds to your hand as if it were a natural extension of your arm. It’s time to fight and to lead.<br/>
			<b>Play Style</b>: Commanders tell other characters what to do. A commander who isn’t a team player is a lonely warrior who needs to get over it and rejoin their warband or adventuring party in order to do what they do best: dole out commands.<br/>
			&emsp;The commander aims to tell other player characters what to do without interfering too often in the turn-by-turn structure of the round. That’s why commands take effect on the turn of an ally who is already taking their turn. Tactics are usually used on the commander’s turn, but they’re limited by how many times they can be used each day.<br/>
			&emsp;Choosing how and when you’ll spend command points to help your allies may be challenging for a novice player. Actually, that’s not entirely true. The challenge level of the class might not be so bad. But straightforward characters usually work best for novice players and the commander’s options are laced with subtleties, starting with how you’ll choose between commands and tactics as you create your character.<br/>
			<b>Backgrounds</b>: Commanders have backgrounds similar to fighters and some paladins and rangers.<br/>
			&emsp;Some backgrounds include: Frost Range mercenary, historical re-enactor, sergeant of the city guard, street gang survivor, ex-gladiator, wilderness scout, cobbler, bouncer, exotic dancer, Queen’s Wood patroller, Axis wargame veteran, Imperial squad leader, reformed drunk, and officer of the Crusader’s Guard.

			<h5>Class Features</h5>

			<p class="initial">All commanders have class features associated with commands and tactics. Commands allow you to help your allies fight better. You issue them as interrupt actions during their turn. To issue a command, the ally must be conscious, but line of sight isn’t required. All commands are at-will powers, though they do cost command points, and are usually limited to once per round (as an interrupt).</p>
			<p>You start each battle with 1 command point and generally gain more via the two standard commander features: Fight from the Front and Weigh the Odds. Excess command points go away at the end of the battle.</p>
			<p>Your powers also include tactics that have immediate effect during your turn. Tactics, as opposed to commands, don’t use command points. You also don’t have to wait around for an ally’s turn to use them. However, tactics don’t always recharge after a battle. You can choose the commands and tactics you want to use. A 1st-level commander starts with a total of 4 commands and tactics. An effective commander should choose a good balance of commands and tactics.</p>

			<h7>Fight from the Front</h7>
			<p>When you hit with a commander melee attack during your turn, gain 1d3 command points.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You now gain 1d4 command points when you hit with a melee attack during your turn instead of 1d3.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: When you make a melee attack during your turn and miss with a natural even roll, gain 1 command point.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Twice per day when you hit with a melee attack, you can gain additional command points equal to double your Strength modifier.</p>

			<h7>Weigh the Odds</h7>
			<p>Standard action<br/>
			<b>Effect</b>: Gain 1d4 command points.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Once per day, add a +4 bonus to the number of command points you gain when you use this action.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Once per battle while the escalation die is 3+, you can gain 1d4 command points as a quick action.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: You now gain 1d6 command points instead of 1d4 when you use this action.</p>

			<h5>Class Talents</h5>

			<p class="initial">Choose three of the following class talents. You get an additional commander talent at 5th level.</p>

			<h7>Armor Skills</h7>
			<p>Unlike other commanders, you take no attack penalties for fighting in heavy armor. (As indicated on your class chart, your base AC in heavy armor is 14.)</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: When an enemy misses you with a melee attack and rolls a natural 1 or 2, you gain 1 command point.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Once per day as a free action when you are hit by an attack that targets AC, you can take half damage from that attack instead.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Once per day as a free action, you can gain a bonus to AC equal to the current escalation die until the end of the battle. (The AC bonus increases or decreases as the escalation die increases or decreases.)</p>

			<h7>Battle Captain</h7>
			<p>Once per battle when you have 2 or more command points left after giving a command, you can use another interrupt action on a different ally’s turn before the start of your next turn.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You now only need to have 1 or more command points left instead of 2.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: You can use this talent twice per battle.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: You gain an additional command point at the start of each round while the escalation die is 4+.</p>

			<h7>Combat Maneuver</h7>
			<p>Choose a fighter maneuver of your level or lower. You can use it like a fighter. You can also switch it for a different maneuver each time you level up.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You gain the adventurer feat for the maneuver you chose, if any.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Choose a second fighter maneuver of your level or lower to use.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: You gain the adventurer and champion tier feats, if any, for both your fighter maneuvers.</p>

			<h7>Destined to Lead</h7>
			<p>When you roll a 5 or 6 on an icon relationship die, you gain 2 bonus command points that last until the end of the current game session, no matter what events occur due to the advantage gained with that icon. When you use one or more of these bonus command points, tell a story about how something related to the icon (or icons!) comes into play to make you a better/luckier/destined commander.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You now gain the 2 bonus command points when you roll a 4 with an icon relationship die as well.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Once per session when you roll icon relationship dice, you can reroll one die that isn’t a 5 or a 6.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: When you roll icon relationship dice, for each 6 you get, you and each nearby ally gain a +1 bonus to death saves until the next full heal-up.</p>

			<h7>Forceful Command</h7>
			<p>When you give a command that lets an ally roll a d20 (an attack, a save, etc.), you can spend additional command points before the roll up to the escalation die value, or 1 point if the escalation die is still 0. That ally gains a +2 bonus to the roll for each point you spend this way.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You begin each battle with 1 additional command point.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Once per battle, you can use a command on a far away ally.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Once per day when you use this talent to grant an ally a bonus to a d20 roll, you can also allow that ally to reroll that roll once as a free action.</p>

			<h7>Into the Fray</h7>
			<p>At the start of each battle before you and your allies roll initiative, roll a d4. A number of your allies equal to the roll gain the following benefit of your choice: a +4 bonus to initiative that battle; OR a +2 bonus to AC until the end of the first round.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You also gain the chosen bonus.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: The +2 bonus to AC also applies to PD and MD.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: You and the chosen allies now gain both bonuses (+2 to all defenses for the first round and +4 to initiative this battle).</p>

			<h7>Martial Training</h7>
			<p>Unlike other commanders, you don’t take a –2 attack penalty when fighting with heavy weapons.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You gain 1 command point whenever you roll a natural 19 or 20 with a melee attack.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Twice per day as a free action (once per turn), you can reroll one of your melee attack rolls.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Twice per day as free action (once per turn) when you hit with a melee attack, you can deal 1d10 extra damage to the target for each positive or conflicted icon relationship point you have with warrior or leader icons in your game.</p>

			<h7>Moment of Glory</h7>
			<p>When you roll initiative, also roll a d4 and record the result. As a free action, you can add the result to a single attack roll made by one of your nearby allies later this battle. (It’s a free action, so you can add the result after seeing the roll.)</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You can also add the d4 result to a save or dicey-move roll made by an ally.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Roll a d6 instead of a d4.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: In addition to the d6 you roll with initiative, roll a d4. You can also use that roll the same way, but not during the same turn you use the d6 result.</p>

			<h7>Never Say Die</h7>
			<p>Once per battle when an enemy scores a critical hit against you or a nearby ally, you can increase the escalation die by 1.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Once per day, you can use this talent twice in the same battle.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: When you use this talent, the target of the critical hit can heal using a recovery.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: When you use this talent, you and each of your nearby allies gains a +2 bonus to all defenses until the end of your next turn.</p>

			<h7>Strategist</h7>
			<p>You start every battle with 1 additional command point. In addition, you gain 1 additional point in a background related to military history, strategy, command, or warfare. You can use this background point to raise that background beyond the normal maximum of 5.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: When you roll a die to find out how many allies one of your commands, tactics, or talents targets, add +1 to the result.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Once per day as a free action, you can gain 4 command points.</p>

			<h7>Sword of Victory</h7>
			<p>When your melee attack drops a non-mook enemy to 0 hp, or drops three or more mooks, you gain 1 command point.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You only have to drop 2 or more mooks instead of 3 to gain the command point.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: You gain 2 command points instead of 1 when you drop a non-mook enemy or 2 or more mooks to 0 hp.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Once per day as a free action, you can gain 4 command points.</p>

			<h7>Tactician</h7>
			<p>One battle per day, you and up to two nearby allies can reroll their initiative if they don’t like the first result. They must take the re-rolled result. In addition, you gain 1 additional point in a background related to military history, strategy, command, or warfare. You can use this background point to raise that background beyond the normal maximum of 5.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Once per day after a battle, you can gain a +4 bonus to all recharge rolls you make for your expended tactics.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Once per day as a free action, you can choose a tactic you don’t normally possess and use it as if you did (you don’t get any feats associated with it).</p>
