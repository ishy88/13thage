			"My mind is a far deadlier weapon than some ill-crafted bit of iron."
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>Overview</b>: As wanderers, mercenaries, and adventurers, battleminds are carefree warriors who seek only to test their skill against the mightiest and most dangerous opponents. Battleminds possess a potent combination of psionic and physical skill, allowing them to use their minds to manipulate and deceive their foes even as their fighting skill lets them carve a swath through enemy ranks. Battleminds tend to be bold and sometimes arrogant, an attitude earned through bringing ruin to enemies over the course of many conflicts.<br/>
			&emsp;You might not share your fellow battleminds’ arrogance, but you do have access to an array of combat abilities that let you manipulate, baffle, and defeat your enemies. Your mind is as deadly as your weapon, and with the aid of your psionic magic, your body can turn aside attacks as effectively as a suit of plate armor can.<br/>
			&emsp;Let those who would stand against your might quiver in terror when you approach, for you are a battlemind, and supremacy in combat is your birthright.<br/>
			<b>Play Style</b>: The battlemind is a heavily armored and armed warrior whose physical abilities are augmented with mental might.<br/>
			&emsp;The battlemind is simple to play. Your choices during combat come from your talents since you don’t choose new attacks or spells as you rise in level. Most every attack you make uses your basic melee attack, but you can augment it by using Psionic Defense or one of the other abilities from your talents.<br/>
			&emsp;Battleminds who want a bit more complexity can choose talents that let them borrow from other classes.<br/>
			<b>Backgrounds</b>: Possible backgrounds include: city guardsman, combat medic, bodyguard, outlaw hunter, and inquisitor.<br/>

		</div>

		<div id="class-features" class="tabcontent" style="display: block">
			<h5>Class Features</h5>
			<p class="initial">All battleminds have the Psionic Defense class feature.</p>

			<h7>Psionic Defense</h7>
			<p>You may use Psionic Defense once per battle, plus an additional number of times per day equal to your Mage attribute. Activating Psionic Defense is a free action, and you may choose one of the following effects.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><i>Mind Spike</i>: Your next melee attack inflicts +1d4 force damage per level, and deals half damage on a miss.</li>
				<li><i>Psychic Shield</i>: The next time you hit with melee attack, you and one nearby ally gain temporary HP equal to four times your level.</li>
				<li><i>Battlemind’s Demand</i>: The next time you hit with a melee attack, the target suffers a -10 penalty to disengage checks (save ends).</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You may use Psionic Defense two additional times per day.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Your Mind Spike’s extra damage increases to +1d6 per level. Your Psychic Shield instead grants temporary HP equal to six times your level. Your Battlemind’s Demand affects all enemies you are engaged with when you hit with a melee attack.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: When you hit with Mind Spike, you also inflict vulnerable (save ends). When you grant temporary HP with Psychic Shield, each target may make a save against an effect that a save would end. Enemies must succeed on a hard save (16+) to end the effects of your Battlemind’s Demand.</p>

			<h5>Class Talents</h5>

			<p class="initial">Choose three of the following class talents. You get an additional battlemind class talent at 5th level, and again at 8th level.</p>

			<h7>Avenger’s Wrath</h7>
			<p>You can’t take this talent if you take the <i>Protector’s Grace</i> talent.</p>
			<p>When one of your Mind Spike attacks drops a non-mook enemy to 0 hp, that use of Psionic Defense is not expended.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Once per day, you can reroll your relationship dice with any icon.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: When one of your Mind Spike attacks drops three or more mooks, it is not expended.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: You gain an additional relationship point with any icon.</p>

			<h7>Bastion</h7>
			<p>You gain +1 AC.</p>
			<p>In addition, once per battle when a nearby ally is hit by an attack, you can choose to lose hit points equal to half of that damage, and have your ally take only half of the damage instead. The damage you lose can come from temporary hit points, but isn’t affected by damage resistance and other tricks to avoid the damage.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Your total number of recoveries increases by one. When the escalation die reaches 3, you gain an additional use of Bastion.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Your total recoveries increases by one (for a total of +2 from this talent). Once per battle, when the escalation die is 3+, you can Rally as a quick action.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: When using Bastion, your ally takes no damage (you still lose hit points equal to half the damage).</p>

			<h7>Battlemind’s Challenge</h7>
			<p>When you hit an enemy with a melee attack, you can choose to challenge that enemy as a free action. Until the end of the battle, provided that both you and the enemy you’ve challenged are conscious and capable of making an attack, you each take a -4 attack penalty against all other creatures and a -4 penalty to disengage checks from each other.</p>
			<p>The attack penalty temporarily deactivates for the attacker when they make an attack roll against their rival, but only until the end of the attacker’s turn. For example, if a creature with more than one attack attacks you first, its subsequent attacks against your allies are without the challenge penalty. However, the attack penalty resets at the end of its turn, so it does not help with opportunity attacks against your allies later in the round.</p>
			<p>You can only have one enemy challenged at a time.</p>
			<p>Your Battlemind’s Challenge ends when</p>
			<ul>
				<li>you or the creature you are challenging falls unconscious or drops to 0 hp.</li>
				<li>you hit a different enemy with an attack (assuming you hit with the –4 penalty).</li>
				<li>the creature flees far away and you choose to end the challenge.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>An enemy can only be the subject of one Battlemind’s Challenge at a time; a new challenge overrides the previous one.</p>
			<p>In the case in which two battleminds fight each other, any use of Battlemind’s Challenge locks them into a challenge that only ends when one of them drops.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: The attack and disengage penalty for challenged enemies (but not for you) is equal to -4 or to the escalation die, whichever is higher.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: You can have two challenges active at the same time against different enemies.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Enemies you challenge are vulnerable to your attacks.</p>

			<h7>Empathy</h7>
			<p>Choose one 1st level Ardent battle cry. That battle cry is now part of your powers. You can change out this battle cry on a full rest.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Whenever you Rally in battle, you heal all nearby allies an amount of HP equal to your Mage attribute (Double your Mage attribute at 5th level. Triple it at 8th level).</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: You gain a second battle cry, of 3rd level or lower.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: You gain a third battle cry, of 5th level or lower.</p>

			<h7>Fearless</h7>
			<p>You are immune to fear abilities and to any non-damage effects of attacks named or described as fear attacks.</p>
			<p>In addition, you gain a +1 melee attack bonus against enemies that are not engaged by any of your allies. The bonus increases to +2 against enemies with fear abilities.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You gain a +1 bonus to death saves.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: You gain a +1 bonus to all saves except death saves.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Your nearby allies gain a +1 bonus to death saves.</p>

			<h7>Harrying Step</h7>
			<p>Once per battle, when an enemy successfully disengages from you, you may declare that you are using your harrying step. At the end of that enemy’s turn, if that enemy is nearby, you may teleport to engage that enemy as a free action.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You gain a +2 bonus to disengage checks.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: When you use your harrying step, you gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls against the enemy you targeted until the end of your next turn.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: You may use your harrying step twice per battle.</p>

			<h7>Implacable</h7>
			<p>You can roll saves at the start of your turn instead of at the end of your turn. A successful save against ongoing damage, for example, means that you will not take the ongoing damage that turn.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You gain a +1 bonus to saves.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Once during your turn as a free action, you can choose to lose hit points equal to your level to reroll a save.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: You gain a +1 bonus to Physical Defense and Mental Defense.</p>

			<h7>Leadership</h7>
			<p>Choose one 1st level commander tactic. That tactic is now part of your powers. You can change out this tactic on a full rest.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Whenever you Rally in battle, all your nearby allies gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls until the end of your next turn.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: You gain a second tactic, of 3rd level or lower.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: You gain a third tactic, of 5th level or lower.</p>

			<h7>Protector’s Grace</h7>
			<p>You can’t take this talent if you take the Avenger’s Wrath talent.</p>
			<p>Your nearby allies gain a +1 bonus to all saves.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Once per day, you can reroll your relationship dice with any icon.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: All of your melee and ranged attacks deal force damage.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: You gain an additional relationship point with any icon.</p>

			<h7>Psychic Reinforcement</h7>
			<p>Twice per day as a quick action, you can heal yourself or an ally next to you with a touch. You spend the recovery while the recipient heals as if they had spent the recovery.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Add twice your Mage attribute to the healing provided by Psychic Reinforcement.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Psychic Reinforcement healing uses a free recovery instead of one of your own.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: You can now use Psychic Reinforcement four times per day instead of two.</p>
