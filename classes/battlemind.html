		<p>
			<b>Overview</b>:In every age, extraordinary men and women have stepped forward to carry the battle flag of justice. By the will of the gods, paladins are both protectors and avengers whose campaigns of awesome justice serve as warnings to any who threaten those under their protection. The people depend on them, lords celebrate them, and monsters hate them. People have never needed paladins more than they do in the 13th Age.<br/>
			&emsp;To you is given the responsibility to unflinchingly stand before an enemy’s charge, smiting them with your sword while protecting your allies with your sacrifice. Where others waver and wonder, your motivation is pure and simple, and your devotion is your strength. Where others scheme and steal, you take the high road, refusing to allow the illusions of temptation to dissuade you from your obligations.<br/>
			&emsp;Take up your blessed sword and sanctified shield, brave warrior, and charge forward to hallowed glory!<br/>
			<b>Play Style</b>: The paladin is a heavily armored and fanatically devoted warrior of the gods—or of causes so pure they don’t require gods to make them holy.<br/>
			&emsp;Like the barbarian, the paladin is simple to play. Your choices during combat come from your talents since you don’t choose new attacks or spells as you rise in level. Most every attack you make uses your basic melee attack, but you can augment it by using Smite Evil or one of the other abilities from your talents.<br/>
			&emsp;Paladins who want a bit more complexity can choose talents that let them cast a cleric spell or use a cleric domain.<br/>
			<b>Backgrounds</b>: Possible backgrounds include: city guardsman, combat medic, bodyguard, outlaw hunter, and inquisitor.

			<h5>Class Features</h5>
			<p class=initial>All paladins have the <i>channel divinity</i> class feature.</p>

			<h7>Channel Divinity</h7>
			<p>You can channel divinity once per battle, plus an additional number of times per day as according to Table: The Paladin. Activating channel divinity is a free action, and you may choose one of the following effects:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Smite Evil</b>: Your next paladin melee attack inflicts +1d4 holy damage per level, and deals half damage on a miss.</li>
				<li><b>Divine Vigor</b>: The next time you hit with paladin melee attack, you and one nearby ally gain temporary HP equal to four times your level.</li>
				<li><b>Divine Challenge</b>: The next time you hit with a paladin melee attack, the target suffers a -10 penalty to disengage checks (save ends).</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You may use Channel Divinity two additional times per day.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Your Smite Evil’s extra damage increases to +1d6 per level. Your Divine Vigor instead grants temporary HP equal to six times your level. Your Divine Challenge affects all enemies you are engaged with when you hit with a basic attack.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: When you hit with Smite Evil, you also inflict vulnerable (save ends). When you grant temporary HP with Divine Vigor, each target may make a save against an effect that a save would end. Enemies must succeed on a hard save (16+) to end the effects of your Divine Challenge.</p>
</p>

			<h5>Class Talents</h5>

			<p class="initial">Choose three of the following class talents. You get an additional paladin class talent at 5th level, and again at 8th level.</p>

			<h7>Bastion</h7>
			<p>You gain +1 AC. In addition, once per battle when a nearby ally is hit by an attack, you can choose to lose hit points equal to half of that damage, and have your ally take only half of the damage instead. The damage you lose can come from temporary hit points, but isn’t affected by damage resistance and other tricks to avoid the damage.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Your total recoveries increases by one. When the escalation die reaches 3, you gain an additional use of Bastion.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Your total recoveries increases by one (for a total of +2 from this talent). Once per battle, when the escalation die is 3+, you can Rally as a quick action.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: When using Bastion, your ally takes no damage (you still lose hit points equal to half the damage).</p>

			<h7>Cleric Training</h7>
			<p>Choose one cleric spell of your level or lower. That spell is now part of your powers. (You can change out the spell normally.)</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You gain a +1 to attack rolls and +1/tier to damage rolls with any cleric spells you cast.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: You can now cast the cleric class feature heal spell twice per day.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Choose a second cleric spell.</p>

			<h7>Divine Domain</h7>
			<p><i>Special</i>: You can choose Divine Domain a second time, if you wish, at 5th level or at 8th level.</p>
			<p>Choose one of the domains listed in the cleric’s class talent list. You gain all the domain’s advantages, including the ability to use the domain’s invocation once per day. If the domain you choose is designed to help cleric spells and attacks, reinterpret the talent to help your paladin powers. You can use the domain’s feats if you wish; reinterpret them similarly if necessary.</p>

			<h7>Fearless</h7>
			<p>You are immune to fear abilities and to any non-damage effects of attacks named or described as fear attacks. In addition, you gain a +1 melee attack bonus against enemies that are not engaged by any of your allies. The bonus increases to +2 against enemies with fear abilities.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You gain a +1 bonus to death saves.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: You gain a +1 bonus to all saves, including death saves. This feat does not stack with the adventurer-tier feat.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Your nearby allies gain a +1 bonus to death saves.</p>

			<h7>Implacable</h7>
			<p>You can roll saves at the start of your turn instead of at the end of your turn. A successful save against ongoing damage, for example, means that you will not take the ongoing damage that turn.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You gain a +1 bonus to saves.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Once during your turn as a free action, you can choose to lose hit points equal to your level to reroll a save.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: You gain a +1 bonus to Physical Defense and Mental Defense.</p>

			<h7>Lay on Hands</h7>
			<p>Twice per day as a quick action, you can heal yourself or an ally next to you with a touch. You spend the recovery while the recipient heals as if they had spent the recovery.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Add a +10 bonus to the healing provided by Lay on Hands. +15 at 5th level, +20 at 8th.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Lay on Hands healing uses a free recovery instead of one of your own.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: You can now use Lay on Hands four times per day instead of two.</p>

			<h7>Leadership</h7>
			<p>Choose one commander tactic of your level or lower. That tactic is now part of your powers. You can change out this tactic on a full rest.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Whenever you Rally in battle, all nearby allies gain a +1 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: The bonus to AC now also applies to PD and MD.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Choose a second tactic.</p>

			<h7>Paladin’s Challenge</h7>
			<p>When you hit an enemy with a melee attack, you can choose to challenge that enemy as a free action. Until the end of the battle, provided that both you and the enemy you’ve challenged are conscious and capable of making an attack, you each take a –4 attack penalty against all other creatures and a –4 penalty to disengage checks from each other.<br/>
			&emsp;The attack penalty temporarily deactivates for the attacker when they make an attack roll against their rival, but only until the end of the attacker’s turn. For example, if a creature with more than one attack attacks you first, its subsequent attacks against your allies are without the challenge penalty. However, the attack penalty resets at the end of its turn, so it does not help with opportunity attacks against your allies later in the round.<br/>
			&emsp;You can only have one enemy challenged at a time.<br/>
			&emsp;Your Paladin’s Challenge ends when<br/>
			<ul>
				<li>You or the creature you are challenging falls unconscious or drops to 0 hp.</li>
				<li>You hit a different enemy with an attack (assuming you hit with the –4 penalty).</li>
				<li>The creature flees far away.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>&emsp;An enemy can only be the subject of one Paladin’s Challenge at a time; a new challenge overrides the previous one. In the unlikely case in which two paladins fight each other, any use of Paladin’s Challenge locks them into a challenge that only ends when one of them drops.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: The attack and disengage penalty for challenged enemies (but not for you) is equal to –4 or to the escalation die, whichever is higher.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: You can have two challenges active at the same time against different enemies.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Enemies you challenge are vulnerable to your attacks.</p>

			<h7>Path of Universal Righteous Endeavor</h7>
			<p>You can’t take this talent if you take the <i>Way of Evil Bastards</i> talent.</p>
			<p>Your nearby allies gain a +1 bonus to all saves.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Once per day, you can reroll your relationship dice with a heroic icon.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Unless you choose otherwise, all of your melee and ranged attacks deal holy damage.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: You gain an additional relationship point with a heroic icon.</p>

			<h7>Rallying Cry</h7>
			<p>Choose one 1st level bard battle cry. That battle cry is now part of your powers. You can change out this battle cry on a full rest.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Whenever you Rally in battle, you heal all nearby allies for 5 HP. At 5th level, the healing increases to 10. At 8th level, the healing increases to 15.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: You gain a second battle cry, of 3rd level or lower.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: You gain a third battle cry, of 5th level or lower.</p>

			<h7>Way of Evil Bastards</h7>
			<p>You can’t take this talent if you take the <i>Path of Universal Righteous Endeavor</i> talent.</p>
			<p>When one of your Smite Evil attacks drops a non-mook enemy to 0 hp, that use of Channel Divinity is not expended.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Once per day, you can reroll your relationship dice with a villainous or ambiguous icon.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: When one of your Smite Evil attacks drops three or more mooks, it is not expended.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: You gain an additional relationship point with a villainous or ambiguous icon.</p>
