			"The fate of the world rests on the fire of your passions."

		<p>
			<b>Overview</b>: Those who let their base emotions rule them invite madness and destruction. Prolonged feelings of fear, greed, lust, or hatred can weaken the mind's defenses against manipulation. Wielding psionic mantles, you excite such emotions in your enemies, creating gaps in their defenses and frustrating their attacks, all while filling your allies with encouraging thoughts and guarding them against despair and other negative emotions.<br/>
			&emsp;Ardents rarely learn their art through formal training. In many ways, they are incidental leaders, having stumbled onto psionic power at some point earlier in their lives. How you discovered your psionic talent can shape how you wield this power now. You might have awakened to your talent in the heat of battle, experiencing a mental breakthrough that allowed you to augment your attacks by rending your enemies' minds. Or your friends might reflect your power when your mood bleeds into theirs, altering their emotional states to match your own. Regardless of the revelation, you learned to harness this power to support your fighting prowess and to guide your allies to victory. <br/>
			<b>Play Style</b>: Ardents are flexible characters with many options both in and out of combat. They’re not the best character choice for beginning players, but can be a lot of fun for experienced players who enjoy mastering different types of abilities and performing as jacks or jills of all trades.<br/>
			<b>Backgrounds</b>: Ardents come from all walks of life. If you’re stuck for inspiration after the sample backgrounds that follow, look at the sample lists for fighters and rogues&mdash;most could apply.<br/>
			&emsp;Possible backgrounds include wandering minstrel, court jester, mercenary, tavern owner, failed monastic disciple, diplomat, spy, royal taster, caravan guide, and smuggler.

			<h5>Class Features</h5>
			<p class="initial">As an ardent advances in level, they have three different types of powers to choose in combat: battle cries, mantles, and one-shot disciplines. Mantles and disciplines are chosen using the same slots. Unlike most character classes, ardents use two different basic attributes for their attacks. Their melee and ranged weapon attacks use their choice of Warrior or Rogue, while their disciplines use Mage.</p>

			<h7>Versatile Combatant</h7>
			<p>At first level, an ardent chooses whether to use their Warrior or their Rogue attribute for their basic melee attacks. Barring exceptional circumstances, this decision cannot be changed throughout their career, as with talents.</p>

			<h7>Mantles</h7>
			<p>Ardent mantles last for one or more rounds and end with an emotional burst that carries a big payoff. Although psionic in nature, ardent mantles don’t count as spells; they don’t force the ardent to suffer opportunity attacks from engaged enemies, and they can’t be canceled by effects that can cancel spells. In fact, ardents can use disciplines while in the middle of channeling an ardent mantle.</p>
			<p>Each mantle specifies what type of action starts channeling it. To sustain it during the next round, it requires an action and a d20 check against its sustain target. If successful, the mantle's effects can continue with its sustained effect for that round. (The next round will require another sustain check.) If your attempt to sustain a mantle fails, the mantle’s emotional burst effect resolves immediately, and then the mantle’s power ends. You can start channeling another mantle on your next round.</p>
			<p>You don’t have to try to sustain the mantle at the start of your turn. If you choose not to sustain a mantle, its effects end immediately and you choose whether to use the mantle’s emotional burst effect in the current round or to start channeling a new mantle. You can’t do both.</p>
			<p>Some mantles have an immediate effect that happens each time you start channeling or sustain the mantle. Others have effects that continue throughout the entire round.</p>
			<p>Most mantles stop when an ardent is knocked unconscious or stunned. Having your channeling stopped this way prevents you from getting the emotional burst effect.</p>
			<p>You can only channel one ardent mantle at a time. If you are channeling a mantle (or spend an action to try to sustain a mantle), you can’t start channeling another mantle that round.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Your ardent mantles don’t stop immediately when you are knocked unconscious or stunned. Instead, they continue for one round, giving you the chance to sustain the mantle on your next turn.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: If one of your ardent mantles would end early without you getting the emotional burst effect, roll a normal save. If you succeed, you regain the use of that mantle.</p>

			<h7>Battle Cries</h7>
			<p>Ardents use battle cries to encourage, inspire, warn, and psychically aid their allies. Battle cries are usually triggered by flexible melee attacks. The ardent makes a melee attack and is able to use a battle cry that corresponds to the attack’s natural result, sometimes whether or not the attack hits.</p>
			<p>Instead of making a flexible melee attack to see which battle cry an ardent is able to trigger, they can also generate the effect of any 1st or 3rd level battle cry they know as a standard action. This allows the ardent to choose the particular battle cry they want, at the expense of taking their standard action.</p>
			<p>Bonuses provided by battle cries can help an ardent’s allies but not the ardent.</p>

			<h7>Disciplines</h7>
			<p>Ardents use psionic disciplines that function like the spells of other classes. Some disciplines are daily, some recharge, and others are at-will.</p>

			<h5>Class Talents</h5>

			<p class="initial">Choose three of the following class talents.</p>

			<h7>Catalyst</h7>
			<p>You cannot take this talent if you have taken the <i>Siphon</i> talent.</p>
			<p>Once per day as a quick action when the escalation die is 1+, you may unleash the inner potential of a nearby ally. Until the end of the battle, that ally rolls 2d20 for each of their attacks and uses the highest result.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: When the unleashed ally hits with a basic attack or an at-will spell or power they may choose to burn through their reserves of power in one devastating strike, dealing an additional +1d10 damage per level with the attack and ending the unleashed potential effect.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: The unleashed ally also gains a +2 bonus to MD and PD as long as this ability is in effect.</p>

			<h7>Disciplined</h7>
			<p>You cannot take this talent if you have taken the <i>Psychic Scream</i> talent.</p>
			<p>You can choose an extra ardent mantle or discipline at the highest level you know. In addition, when you use a daily ardent discipline, you gain a +1 bonus to sustain rolls for the rest of the battle. This bonus is cumulative.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: While at least one of your ardent mantles is active, you and nearby allies gain a +1 bonus to PD and MD.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: When the escalation die is odd and you successfully sustain an ardent mantle, you may choose to end your ardent mantle without generating the emotional burst effect. In return, you regain the use of the ardent mantle, but you cannot activate a new ardent mantle this turn.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: You gain a +1 bonus to sustain rolls for your ardent mantles. You may have two active ardent mantles at a time, but you must sustain each one separately.</p>

			<h7>Empowered Mantle</h7>
			<p>When you attempt to maintain an ardent mantle, take some time to describe how your radiating emotions shape the battle. If you do, you get a bonus of +2 to maintain the mantle.</p>
			<p>This talent is for those that enjoy improvisation.</p>

			<h7>Mantle of Knowledge</h7>
			<p>Take two additional points of backgrounds. You can use these additional points to raise a background that has something to do with history, religion, mythology, or psionic knowledge up to a rating of +6.</p>
			<p>Take a single point of relationship with an icon. Add the point to a relationship you already have up to your normal maximum, or start a new one—positive, conflicted, or negative.</p>

			<h7>Mental Anchor</h7>
			<p>You and your nearby allies gain a +2 bonus to initiative checks.</p>
			<p>In addition, when you rally, one nearby ally may rally as a free action (they still spend a recovery).</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: The initiative bonus increases to +4.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Once per battle, when the escalation die is 2+, you may rally as a quick action.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: When you rally, you and the nearby ally who rallies alongside you add +3d8 hp to their recoveries.</p>

			<h7>Psionic Dabbler</h7>
			<p>Choose one:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><i>Battlemind</i>: You may use the battlemind’s psionic defense feature a number of times per day equal to your Mage attribute. You may also take psionic defense feats up to your tier.</li>
				<li><i>Monk</i>: Choose a monk form of your tier or lower, you gain that form’s attacks – opening, flow, and finishing – as bonus powers. You follow the normal requirements for monks in the order in which you may use these powers. Note that spending one or more turns in the middle of a form using ardent battle cries or disciplines will not lose your place in the form.</li>
				<li><i>Psion</i>: You can choose one discipline from the discipline list of the psion, of your own level or lower, as an extra discipline you know how to use. You can even take its feats up to your tier, if it has any. You may only choose from the discipline list—not from talents. This discipline is a bonus discipline, not included in your ardent class count. In addition, you gain the ability to gain psionic focus as the psion.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: If you chose the battlemind, you also gain proficiency in heavy armor. If you chose the monk, you also gain the ability to use PUNCH damage for your basic melee attacks and the ability to wear magic bracers. If you chose the psion, you also gain the psion’s mind blast feature.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Choose a class you have not already chosen for this talent. You gain the benefit for that class. You do not gain the added benefit from the adventurer tier feat for that class.</p>

			<h7>Psychic Scream</h7>
			<p>You cannot take this talent if you have taken the <i>Disciplined</i> talent.</p>
			<p>Increase the number of battle cries you know by one. The bonus battle cry can be from your highest possible level. In addition, you gain proficiency with shields.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: When the escalation die is odd, you may target yourself instead of an ally with your battle cries, and you may also subtract one from the natural rolls of your battle cries.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: When you use a battle cry on yourself, it also effects an ally.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: You gain a +1 bonus to AC and PD. When the escalation die is 6, you can use your battle cries to help yourself.</p>

			<h7>Siphon</h7>
			<p>You cannot take this talent if you have taken the Catalyst talent.</p>
			<p>Whenever you use a melee attack to hit an enemy who is confused, dazed, stunned, or weakened, you gain a number of temporary hitpoints equal to your Mage attribute (Double your Mage attribute at 5th level; Triple it at 8th level). Remember that temporary hitpoints don’t stack!</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: When a nearby enemy who is confused, dazed, stunned, or weakened dies, you gain a number of temporary hitpoints equal to double your Mage attribute (Quadruple your Mage attribute at 5th level; Sextuple it at 8th level).</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Once per battle when you gain temporary hit points from this talent, one nearby ally you can see may gain an equal amount of temporary hitpoints.</p>
