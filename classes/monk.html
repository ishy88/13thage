			<b>Overview</b>: From high in forbidding mountains to deep in the alleys of a city's meanest district, the ascetic warriors known as monks practice their art. By focusing on their minds and bodies, honing both to near perfec­tion, they master a fighting art that allows them to deliver a punch with the force of a giant's club and to absorb attacks as easily as a heavily armored knight. Monks tap into the potential that rests within themselves, turning that energy further inward to fortify their bodies and sharpen their minds.<br/>
			&emsp;The road opens wide before you. With little more than a walking stick and perhaps a satchel of food, you are ready to take on whatever the world can throw at you. Your years of training taught you to turn your eye inward. Now it is time to look outward and test yourself against the world's dangers.<br/>
			<b>Play Style</b>: Monks are great fun for experienced players who like juggling significant decisions within the flow of moment-by-moment roleplaying. You'll make significant decisions when building your character out of interwoven options and fighting round-by-round using the diverse elements of the monk's attack forms. Some inexperienced players can handle playing a monk, others can't.<br/>
			<b>Backgrounds</b>: Here are a few representative monk background options:<br/>
			&emsp;Temple acolyte, mountain sanctuary guardsman, traveling circus acrobat, river guide, Cathedral runner, spider-cult assassin, tunnel vermin exterminator, bodyguard, farmer, hallucinogenic mushroom farmer, wild mountain ginseng harvester, traveling tournament organizer, civil rights organizer, star pupil of the School of Unified Dragons.

			<h5>Class Features</h5>

			<p class="initial">All monks have attacks dealing JAB, PUNCH, and KICK damage, use forms as the basis of their actions during each round, use power points, and are considered to fight with two-weapons even when they’re just fighting with their fists and feet. They also can take advantage of magical bracers.</p>

			<h7>Jab, Punch, and Kick attacks</h7>
			<p>Under normal circumstances, melee weapons are just special effects for monks. Most monk attacks are rated as JAB, PUNCH or KICK attacks, in the same sense that most fighter attacks are WEAPON attacks.</p>
			<div class="indent">
				<p>&bull; JAB attacks deal 1d6 damage per level</p>
				<p>&bull; PUNCH attacks deal 1d8 damage per level.</p>
				<p>&bull; KICK attacks deal 1d10 damage per level.</p>
			</div>
			<p>When fighting barehanded, with bracers, or with weapons, monks use damage dice based on the form they are attacking with, or PUNCH damage for basic melee attacks. (See Melee Weapons) While using a magic weapon, monks add the weapon’s attack and damage bonus to their attacks, and they can use that weapon’s power(s).</p>

			<h7>Forms</h7>
			<p>When you learn a monk form, you learn all three elements of that form: an <i>opening attack</i>, <i>flow attack</i>, and <i>finishing attack</i>. Each element requires a standard action to use (although some standard action elements provide access to free or quick actions you can choose to use or ignore).</p>
			<p>You must follow a specific form progression during battle. Your first attack with a form must be an opening. Your second attack can be a flow attack from ANY form you know or you can “go back” and use another opening. After you use a flow attack, your next monk attack can be a finishing attack from ANY form you know, or you can go back to another opening or flow. After a finishing attack you must start over with an opening if you’re using forms. If you spend a turn without attacking for some reason, you retain your place in the form progression. It’s worth noting that this form progression occurs whether you hit or miss with your attack.</p>
			<p><i>Mixing forms</i>: As long as you use the proper element of the form (opening, flow, or finishing attack), you can use an opening, flow, or finishing attack from ANY of the forms you know. Part of the fun of playing a monk character is tracking which moves you have used and announcing the elements/names of the form as they roll out across the rounds.</p>
			<p><i>Defense bonus</i>: When you use an element of a form, you gain an AC bonus until the start of your next turn. After using an opening attack you gain a +1 bonus to AC. After using a flow attack, you gain a +2 bonus to AC. After using a finishing attack, you gain a +3 bonus to AC. If elven grace or some other power lets you use multiple elements of your forms in a turn, the AC bonuses don’t stack but you do get to use the highest bonus.</p>
			<p><i>Keeping track of your forms</i>: Your best choice each round will usually be between all the elements of a single category of attack. If you’re writing out your forms, you’ll want to track all your opening attacks together, all your flow attacks separately, and all your finishing attacks in their own group.</p>

			<h7>Power Points</h7>
			<p>You gain a number of power points each day equal to the amount listed on the Monk level progression chart. You can spend power points to modify the natural result of one of your attack rolls, as explained below. Talents and some feats provide <i>discipline powers</i>, each of which can be activated by spending 1 power point.</p>
			<p>When you take a full healup, you regain all your power points. When you take a quick rest, roll 1d20. If the result is an 8+, you regain 1 power point.</p>
			<p><i>Spending power points to adjust your attack roll</i>: After rolling an attack, you can spend 1 power point as a free action to change your attack’s natural result by 1. The change can be positive or negative. For example, you could change a natural roll of 19 into a natural 20 to cause a critical hit. You could also change a roll of natural 1 to a natural 2, or natural roll of 3 into a natural 2, allowing you to reroll the attack thanks to the monk’s two weapon fighting feature.</p>
			<p><i>Discipline powers</i>: Adventurer-tier talents and a few feats offer additional ways to spend ki points.</p>
			<p><i>Spending power points is a free action</i>: Unless otherwise specified, spending power points is always a free action.</p>
			<p><i>Spend only 1 power point per turn</i>: As a rule you can spend only 1 power point each turn. You can spend multiple power points each round, but only once during your turn and once during each other creature’s turn. The exceptions to this rule are forms that cost multiple power points for a single use and the champion feat below.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You gain 2 additional power points each day.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: You can spend as many power points as you like during a turn. You must spend each power point on a different attack roll or a different discipline power.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Work with your GM to invent a new discipline power related to your one unique thing or some other aspect of your character’s story. If the discipline power is too good and overshadows your other discipline powers (for example, like the quivering palm discipline power), the GM should rule that you can only use it once a day.</p>

			<h7>Two-Weapon Fighting</h7>
			<p>Since monks are trained to strike with all their limbs, they can always be considered to be fighting with two weapons in melee, even when they’re barehanded. As indicated in the 13th Age core rulebook, the principal advantage of “two-weapon fighting” is that you get to reroll your attack when you roll a natural 2 with a melee attack, sticking with the reroll.</p>

			<h7>Bracers as Magic Items</h7>
			<p>Monks get magic weapon style powers from magical bracers. In practice, a monk fighting barehanded looks to bracers for magical advantage. A monk who fights with the monastery’s traditional weapons might use bracers or a magical weapon, but a monk wearing magical bracers can’t use a magical melee weapon at the same time.</p>

			<h5>Adventurer-Tier Talents</h5>

			<p class="initial">Choose three of the following adventurer-tier class talents. You also get an additional monk class talent at 5th level and again at 8th level.</p>

			<h7>Burning Fortress Style &mdash; <i>Five Deadly Secrets</i></h7>
			<p>When you use Burning Fortress Style in a battle, you can’t use any other Five Deadly Secrets talents that battle.</p>
			<p>When an enemy you are engaged with hits you with an attack, it takes 1d6 damage.</p>
			<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" style="width: 40%; text-align: center">

			<table>
			<p><b>Discipline Power</b> <i>(Certain Vengeance Posture)</i>: When an enemy engaged with you hits you with an attack, you can spend 1 power point to make that enemy vulnerable to your monk attacks until the end of the battle.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Once per battle, as an interrupt action, you can choose one nearby or far away enemy. The target must now include you in all its attacks (save ends).</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Once per battle, after an enemy is damaged by Burning Fortress, you may heal yourself for the same amount you dealt in damage.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Once per battle, you can deal Burning Fortress Style damage to a nearby enemy that hits you instead of an engaged enemy.</p>

			<h7>Drunken Style &mdash; <i>Five Deadly Secrets</i></h7>
			<p>When you use Drunken Style in a battle, you can’t use any other Five Deadly Secrets talents that battle.</p>
			<p>As a free action, you may enter a drunken stance. Once you enter this stance, you must pass a normal save to revert to normal. A revert attempt is a quick action. Once in this stance, you no longer may choose which stage of your form to use in a turn. However, you can now use flow and finishing attacks without following the sequence. Whenever you wish to use a form while in drunken stance, roll a d6 and consult the table.</p>
			<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" style="width: 40%; text-align: center">
				<tbody>
					<tr>

						<td>5-6: You use the form’s finishing attack.</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p>If you gain an additional standard action on your turn and wish to spend it on a form while in Drunken Stance, you must roll a d6 to decide which stage for the form to use. If you just wish to use a basic attack or other actions like rally, you do not need to roll a d6 and may perform it as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Discipline Power</b> <i>(Spasmodic Lurch)</i>: [Special: You can only use this power when in a drunken stance] When an enemy attacks and rolls a natural odd roll against your AC, you can spend 1 power point as an interrupt action to only take half damage from the attack.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: The discipline power now affects attacks against both your AC and PD.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: If the attack roll that triggered the discipline power is less than a natural 16, you instead take no damage.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: If an enemy misses you with a natural odd roll below 10, you can make a basic melee attack against that enemy as a free action after the attack.</p>

			<h7>Flurry &mdash; <i>Five Deadly Secrets</i></h7>
			<p>When you use Flurry in a battle, you can’t use any other Five Deadly Secrets talents that battle.</p>
			<p>You gain the following attack:</p>
			<p>
				Melee attack<br/>
				Quick action<br/>
				At-Will (once per round)<br/>
				<b>Special</b>: If you use this when the escalation die is below 3, you only deal half damage on a hit.<br/>
				<b>Target</b>: One enemy<br/>
				<b>Attack</b>: 5 + Level vs. AC<br/>
				<b>Hit</b>: JAB + 5 x tier damage<br/>
				<b>Miss</b>: &mdash;<br/>
			</p>
			<p><b>Discipline Power</b> <i>(A Thousand Palms)</i>: After making a Flurry attack, you can spend 1 power point to make another Flurry attack against a target you have not already attacked with Flurry this turn.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You now deal full damage with Flurry when the escalation die is 2+.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Your Flurry attack now deals damage equal to your level on a miss.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: When the escalation die is 3+, your Flurry attack deals KICK damage instead of PUNCH damage.</p>

			<h7>Greeting Fist &mdash; <i>Five Deadly Secrets</i></h7>
			<p>When you use Greeting Fist in a battle, you can’t use any other Five Deadly Secrets talents that battle.</p>
			<p>The first time you make a melee attack against each enemy during a battle (including the first mook of a mob), the target takes 1d8 extra damage on a hit.</p>
			<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" style="width: 40%; text-align: center">

			</table>
			<p><b>Discipline Power</b> <i>(Opening the Death Gate)</i>: When you deal Greeting Fist damage, you can spend 1 power point to double that damage (as usual, a crit would then triple that damage).</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Once per battle when you miss with your first melee attack against an enemy, you can use Greeting Fist against that enemy later that battle.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Once per battle, you can reroll your Greeting Fist damage dice. You must accept the reroll.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Once per battle, you may reroll an attack that qualified for Greeting Fist damage.</p>

			<h7>Temple Weapon Master &mdash; <i>Five Deadly Secrets</i></h7>
			<p>When you use Temple Weapon Master in a battle, you can’t use any other Five Deadly Secrets talents that battle.</p>
			<p>Once per battle, when using weapons, you may turn a natural even miss into a hit.</p>
			<p><b>Discipline Power</b> <i>(Supreme Warrior Discipline)</i>: When you hit when using a weapon, you can spend 1 power point to gain a bonus to AC equal to the half the current escalation die (round up, minimum 1) until the end of the battle. (The AC bonus increases or decreases as the escalation die increases or decreases.)</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: The AC bonus from the discipline power also applies to your PD.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: When you roll a natural 2 with a monk attack while fighting with a melee weapon, in addition to the reroll you get from Two-Weapon Fighting, you gain a +5 bonus to the rerolled attack.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: One battle per day, the damage dice of your finishing attacks increase by one size (max d12).</p>

			<h7>Heaven's Arrow</h7>
			<p>Your basic ranged attack now deals damage equal to your level on a miss and you no longer take attack penalties with any of the monk’s ranged weapons.</p>
			<p>Once per battle when you would make a melee attack as an element of one of your monk forms, you can use a ranged attack against a nearby or far away enemy instead. This attack deals damage according to the JAB/PUNCH/KICK hierarchy that’s part of the form.</p>
			<p><b>Discipline Power</b> <i>(Empowered Shot)</i>: You can spend 1 power point to gain another use of Heaven's Arrow this battle.</p>

			<h7>Leaf On Wind</h7>
			<p>Once per battle, you may take another move action as a free action. In addition, you may always balance yourself on precarious and/or narrow structures. You are also considered to be weightless when it comes to determining if something can support you. You never take damage from falling from heights less than 100 ft (30 meters) and always land on your feet.</p>
			<p><b>Discipline Power</b> <i>(Wind’s Comrade)</i>: You can spend 1 power point during your turn to gain flight until the end of your turn.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You gain a +3 bonus to disengage checks.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: When an enemy makes an attack against you that targets more than one creature, you only take half damage from that attack, hit or miss.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Roll an easy save at the end of any turn in which you use the discipline power. If you succeed, your flight lasts until the end of your next turn.</p>

			<h7>Phoenix-touched</h7>
			<p>You gain a +2 bonus to saves while you’re not staggered.</p>
			<p>Once per day, as a free action, when you are staggered, you can heal using a recovery. You heal half the hit points you would have healed for the recovery, and one enemy engaged with you of your choice takes the other half in fire damage.</p>
			<p><b>Discipline Power</b> <i>(Rise From The Ashes)</i>: When you are dazed, weakened, confused, hampered, or stunned, you can spend 1 power point to make an immediate normal save (11+), even if that condition is not save ends or would prevent you from taking free actions.

			<p>At 5th level, you gain an additional monk class talent. Choose one of these champion-tier talents or take another adventurer-tier talent.</p>

			<h7>Disciple of the Hidden Flame</h7>
			<p>When you gain this talent, choose a class—cleric, sorcerer, or wizard. Each time you take a full heal-up, choose a spell of your level or lower from that class.</p>
			<p><i>Spell usage</i>: You can cast this spell in place of using one of your opening attacks (if the spell is at-will), flow attacks (if the spell is recharge, per battle, cyclic), or finishing attacks (if the spell is daily).</p>
			<p><b>Discipline Power</b> <i>(Gather the Flame)</i>: You can spend 1 power point when you cast your Disciple of the Hidden Flame spell to cast it as if you possessed the adventurer-tier and champion-tier feat for that spell, if any. At 8th level, treat the spell like you possessed the epic-tier feat for it, if any.</p>

			<h7>Improbable Stunt</h7>
			<p>Once per battle as a quick action, you can pull off an outrageous improvisational stunt that no one else could manage, with the possible exception of a swashbuckling rogue! The stunt is not itself an attack but it might lead to one. The outrageous action of your stunt isn’t something you have to roll for, even if it would ordinarily require a skill check to pull off. As with the Swashbuckle talent of the rogue from the core book, you’ll still have to roll for an attack that follows up your stunt.</p>
			<p><b>Discipline Power</b> <i>(Ludicrously Improbable Maneuver)</i>: You can spend 1 power point to use Improbable Stunt again this battle.</p>

			<h7>Path of the Perfect Warrior</h7>
			<p>One battle per day, you can increase your JAB damage dice to d8s, your PUNCH damage dice to d10s, and your KICK damage dice to d12s.</p>
			<p><b>Discipline Power</b> <i>(Perfect Breath)</i>: Once per day when you heal using a recovery, you can spend 1 power point to heal using a second recovery as well. The second recovery is free.</p>

			<h5>Epic-Tier Talents</h5>
			<p>At 8th level, you gain an additional monk class talent. Choose one of these epic-tier talents, or take another adventurer-tier or champion-tier talent instead.</p>

			<h7>True Master of Forms</h7>
			<p>Once per battle, as a free action, you can skip the element of a form you would normally be required to perform next. For example, if you had performed an opening attack, you could skip to a finishing attack with your next standard action.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Whenever you roll a natural 18+ with a form attack, you can skip the next element of the form that would normally be required.</p>

			<h7>Finish Him</h7>
			<p>When you make a finishing attack, roll an additional d20 (usually two) for the attack roll. Use the result of your choice.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Once per battle when you make a flow attack, you can roll an additional d20 for the attack roll.</p>

			<h7>Font of Energy</h7>
			<p>Once per day, as a standard action, you can summon up your inner power and disperse it amongst yourself and your allies. You and each of your willing allies can make a hard save (16+). Each character who succeeds regains all of their hit points and power points as if they had taken a full heal-up as well as 1 daily ability and 2 recoveries. The only thing that cannot be regained is this power: you must take a full heal-up to regain Font of Energy’s power.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: You and your allies now gain a +4 bonus to their save.</p>
