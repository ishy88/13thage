			"I bring death to the living, and life to the dead."
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>Overview</b>: Necromancers and their magic are gist for terrible stories. Legends speak of mad wizards leading vast, rotting hordes, waging war against the living. These infamous figures are the rare few exceptions among necromancers, despite their prominence in the public attention. Most necromancers have little interest in conquest, instead using their art to examine the secrets of life, death, and the connections between them. It is true that necromancers can raise undead creatures, wield dread magic that rots f lesh and sunders souls, and snuff out life with a whisper, but those who defend the art offer comparisons to other magic: How, they ask, can these abilities be considered more destructive than an evoker’s fireball or more insidious than an enchanter’s charms?<br/>
			&emsp;Do you believe your dark magic can be used for positive ends? Are there sacrifices that are too great, no matter what the reward? Is that skeleton someone you used to know?<br/>
			<b>Play Style</b>: Some of your talent powers and spells are straightforward, while others require weighing the odds whether they will hurt your enemies more than they will hurt you and your friends. There are sacrifices to choose—power that has to be paid for somehow. We’d say that necromancers are better for experienced players, but maybe that’s not true. Maybe newcomers should be handed the keys to summoning and unholy energies. What could possibly go wrong?<br/>
			<b>Backgrounds</b>: Necromancers could be rare in some campaigns, but commonplace in others. Depending on that choice, possible backgrounds for necromancers include: failed village priest, archeologist, fortress defender, swamp baron, judge and executioner, living dungeon escapee, former Necropolis acolyte, death giant servitor, former mummy, reformed outlaw, dreamweed addict, resurrected Imperial hero,and burnt-out wizard.

			<h5>Class Features</h5>

			<p class="initial">All necromancers share the following class features.</p>

			<h7>Death's Master</h7>
			<p>All necromancers must spend at least one relationship point with any necromantic icon. (This may be conflicted or negative.) If your one unique thing somehow suggests that you might be free of this requirement, make a case to your GM that this is a way in which you are unique.</p>

			<h7>Ritual Magic</h7>
			<p>Take two additional points of backgrounds in a background that has to do with undeath or magical knowledge.</p>

			<h7>Summoning</h7>
			<p>Your summoning spells use the following rules:</p>
			<p><b>Standard action spells</b>: Casting a summoning spell generally requires a standard action. The creature(s) you summon appears next to you, though feats or powers might enable you to summon it nearby instead.</p>
			<p><b>Duration</b>: A summoned creature fights for you until the end of the battle or until it drops to 0 hit points. At 0 hp, summoned creatures are slain and removed from the battle.</p>
			<p><b>One summoning spell at a time</b>: Each spellcaster can have only a single summoning spell active at a time. If all the creatures from an earlier summoning spell have been slain, you’re free to cast another. Alternatively, you can dismiss your own previously summoned creatures as a quick action to clear the way for a new summoning spell.</p>
			<p><b>Halfway there</b>: Summoned creatures are not the same as real creatures. They’re partly real, partly magical. Their abilities don’t always match the capabilities of the creatures that the adventurers encounter for real. Sometimes this is reflected in a summoned creature’s attacks or abilities. It’s always reflected in a summoned creature’s hit points.</p>
			<p><b>Hit points</b>: Each summoned creature stat block indicates its base hit points. Starting hit points for summoned creatures are nearly always lower than hit points for non-summoned versions of the same creature. Some class feats might increase the hit points of summoned creatures.</p>
			<p><b>Actions on arrival</b>: The turn you summon a creature, that creature takes its turn immediately after your turn in initiative order. During its turn, the summoned creature can act like any other creature, taking a standard, move, and quick action. The summoned creature continues to take its turn immediately after you (even if your initiative order changes) until the end of the battle.</p>
			<p><b>Escalation die</b>: As a rule, summoned creatures don’t benefit from the escalation die. A summoned creature can add the escalation die to attacks, however, if you use a quick action to give it orders or magical reinforcement. The summoned creature then gets to use the escalation die until the start of your next turn, including for opportunity attacks and other attacks that it gets to make during other creatures’ turns. For example, during the turn you summon the creature, you use a quick action afterward to give it orders, allowing it to use the escalation die bonus. At the start of your next turn, the creature no longer gets to use the escalation die, so you’ll have to use another quick action again during that turn for the creature to keep getting the benefit. If you’ve summoned a mob of mooks, a single quick action lets every member of the mob use the escalation die.</p>
			<p><b>Allies?</b>: Summoned creatures generally count as your allies. Sometimes that’s bad for you—for example, when an effect is going to heal a random ally and the healing is going to be pretty much wasted on the summoned creature (see no recoveries, bad healing below). Sometimes that’s good for you—for example, when a monster’s attack chooses one of its random enemies and your summoned creature takes the hit.</p>
			<p><b>No recoveries, bad healing</b>: Summoned creatures don’t have recoveries. If you cast a healing spell on a summoned creature that requires the use of a recovery, the summoned creature heals hit points equal to your level. If you use an effect that would heal a summoned creature without using a recovery, the summoned creature only heals half the normal hit points of the effect. Temporary hit points still work normally.</p>
			<p><b>No nastier specials</b>: If a creature you’re summoning sometimes has nastier specials when it appears as a monster, that’s not the version of the creature you’re summoning.</p>
			<p><b>Spell or creature?</b>: When a summoning spell is cast, it’s definitely a spell. After casting the spell, a summoned creature is a creature, though if the GM is feeling puckish they might allow effects that generally only interact with spells to interact with a summoned creature. That seems dicey, but it’s possible.</p>
			<p>The following feats enable you to improve your summoning powers.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Your summoned creatures can add the escalation die to their attacks.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: When you summon mooks, increase the number of mooks you summon by 1.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>:The first time one of your non-mook summoned creatures is dropped each battle, roll a normal save. If you succeed, the summoned creature is not slain but instead remains in the battle with 10 hp.</p>

			<h5>Class Talents</h5>

			<p class="initial">Choose three of the following class talents.</p>

			<h7>Cackling Soliloquist</h7>
			<p>If you spend your move action, your quick action, and your standard action casting a daily spell that ordinarily only requires a standard action—while screaming grandiloquently, cackling maniacally, or megalomaniacally describing the grandeur of your plans and the futility of your enemies’ resistance—the daily spell is recharge 18+ after battle instead of daily, and you can invent a slight improvement to the spell, especially if it’s partly story-oriented, that provides an extra benefit determined by the GM or by you (with GM approval).</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You gain temporary hit points equal to 1d6 + 3 + your level when you use Cackling Soliloquist (6 + level at 5th level; 9 + level at 8th level).</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Your soliloquized spell is now a recharge 16+ after battle instead of 18+.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Once per day, you can hog the spotlight when using Cackling Soliloquist. When you do, you heal using a free recovery and steal the escalation die, keeping it all to yourself. Until the end of your next turn, you are the only creature—PC, NPC, or monster—that can use the escalation die, and you treat the escalation die as if it were an 8. At the end of your next turn, return the escalation die to the table, one point higher than it was when you seized it.</p>

			<h7>Dead Wizard</h7>
			<p>You gain the Cantrips class feature from the wizard class. The talent functions like the wizard’s class feature with the following exceptions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can’t cast mending.</li>
				<li>Your light cantrip has a sickly flicker or a dark edge. Feel free to call it darklight.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You can take a wizard spell in place of one of your necromancer spells of the same level. You can change this spell for a new one whenever you take a full heal-up.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: You gain a bonus wizard spell that is at least two levels below your level, in addition to the spells you can cast as a necromancer. You can change this spell for a new one whenever you take a full heal-up.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: You gain a second bonus wizard spell, but this one can be of your level or lower. You can change this spell for a new one whenever you take a full heal-up.</p>

			<h7>Death Priest</h7>
			<p>When you have icon relationship advantages you’re waiting to use during a session, you can interpret them as interactions/public discussions with the spirits of the recent or ancient dead in the area, providing information you require (and possibly, when there’s a complication from a 5 roll, also providing that information to your enemies or otherwise getting you into some type of trouble).</p>
			<p>In addition, once per day while you’re not in battle, you can perform a short rite (1–2 minutes) to call upon a spirit of the dead that’s related to a random icon other than a necromantic icon. The spirit will speak to you, relaying information helpfully, or under protest if it’s related to an icon that considers you an enemy or with which you have a negative relationship.</p>
			<p>You can’t always rely on the dead to speak the truth, or to know what they are talking about. Whenever you use the power above, the GM secretly rolls a d20 before the discussion. On a 3+, the spirit knows what it is talking about. On a 1–2, the information is outdated, sabotaged, or just erroneous. (Note that this roll is not for spirits you talk to thanks to icon advantages mentioned above.)</p>
			<p>At 5th level you can use this power twice per day. At 8th level you can use it three times per day.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: You gain a bonus cleric spell that is at least two levels below your level, in addition to the spells you can cast as a necromancer. You can change this spell for a new one whenever you take a full heal-up. In addition, you gain a +1 to attack rolls and +1/tier to damage rolls with this spell</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: You gain the lowest-tier feat, if any, associated with your bonus cleric spell.</p>

			<h7>Deathknell</h7>
			<p>As a quick action, you can drop a nearby enemy that has 5 hp or fewer down to 0 hp. When you drop an enemy using Deathknell, you heal 1d6 hit points.</p>
			<p>You can use Deathknell to drop a mook, but only if it’s the last mook in its mob and the mob has 5 hp or fewer left.</p>
			<p>3rd level: Drop an enemy with 10 hp or fewer. Heal 1d10 hit points.</p>
			<p>5th level: Drop an enemy with 15 hp or fewer. Heal 2d8 hit points.</p>
			<p>7th level: Drop an enemy with 20 hp or fewer. Heal 4d6 hit points.</p>
			<p>9th level: Drop an enemy with 25 hp or fewer. Heal 4d8 hit points.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: When you use Deathknell, one of your nearby conscious allies can gain the healing instead of you.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Double the healing gained from Deathknell when you drop an enemy.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>:You can increase the escalation die by 1 instead of healing when you kill a non-mook enemy with Deathknell.</p>

			<h7>It’s Complicated</h7>
			<p>When you roll icon relationship dice, the first 6 you roll is a 5 instead.</p>
			<p>You gain an extra necromancer spell at the highest spell level you can normally cast (as shown under spells known on the necromancer level progression chart). For example, you would gain an extra 3rd level spell if you’re 4th level, or an extra 5th level spell if you’re 5th level.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: All 6s you roll with relationship dice count as 5s. You gain another extra necromancer spell, but it must be at least two levels lower than your level.</p>

			<h7>Redeemer</h7>
			<p>Undead you summon release holy energy bursts as they drop to 0 hp, dealing a small amount of damage to each enemy engaged with them.</p>
			<p>Mooks you summon deal 3 holy damage (6 at 5th level; 9 at 8th level).</p>
			<p>Non-mooks you summon deal 3d4 holy damage (3d8 at 5th level; 6d6 at 8th level).</p>
			<p>In story terms, you’re not likely to have a positive relationship with any necromantic icons if you take the Redeemer talent.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: The first time each battle an undead creature you have summoned attacks, it gains a +3 attack bonus.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: When one of your summoned undead creatures drops to 0 hp, instead of having it deal holy damage to engaged enemies, you can heal hit points equal to that damage instead.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: You can memorize a single spell that summons undead twice.</p>

			<h7>Skeletal Minion</h7>
			<p>You have a skeleton minion the same level as you that acts as a servant, fights alongside you in battle, and is replaced by a new skeletal minion when it inevitably collapses or is destroyed. It is not a summoned creature; summoning rules don’t apply.</p>
			<p>Your minion acts on your initiative, taking a standard action, a move action, and (if applicable) a quick action. You decide whether it takes its turn before or after you.</p>
			<p>The listed attack and damage values are for melee attacks. Your skeletal minion can’t heal. When it drops to 0 hp, it’s destroyed for that battle. When you take a quick rest, a new (or patched up) skeletal minion will take its place.</p>

			<p><b>Skeletal Minion Feats</b></p>
			<p>Like animal companion feats, skeletal minion feats don’t build on each other. You don’t have to take them in a particular order, as long as you qualify for the tier.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Your skeletal minion now adds the escalation die to its attack rolls.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: When an enemy attempts to disengage from the skeletal minion, it takes a penalty to the check equal to the escalation die.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: As a quick action, you can set your skeletal minion ablaze, or extinguish the blaze. While it’s flaming, your skeleton minion’s damage dice increase by one size, and it deals fire damage with its melee attacks, but it takes damage equal to your level each time its natural attack roll is odd.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Add a damage die of the same size to your skeletal minion’s damage rolls (for example, 3d6 becomes 4d6).</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Add 10 to your skeletal minion’s hit points. At 8th level, add 15.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Add a damage die of the same size to your skeletal minion’s damage rolls (for example, 4d6 becomes 5d6, and this is cumulative with the champion feat).</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Your skeletal minion gains a +2 bonus to all defenses.</p>

			<h7>Sorta Dead</h7>
			<p>In some ways, you’re dead already. You don’t need to eat or sleep or breathe. You can’t drown in normal water/liquid, though magical gas will still affect you.</p>
			<p>When a spell or effect targets or applies to undead, you can decide whether you want to count as undead for that specific effect. (For example, you could count as undead to take advantage of a target’s vulnerability created by the ripping claws attack of a starving ghoul mook you summoned via summon undead.)</p>
			<p>The first time you die each level, roll a normal save, adding a +3 modifier. If you succeed, you heal using a free recovery instead of dying. If you were dying because of last gasp saves, consider yourself saved from the last gasp problem also.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You gain resist poison 16+ and resist negative energy 16+.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: The spells zombie form, ghoul form, ghost form, and vampiric form all function as recharge 16+ after battle spells for you, though you still memorize them as daily spells.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: No undead creature that is not under the direct command of a necromantic icon can attack you unless you attack it or cast a spell against it first.</p>

				<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: If you wish, the target doesn’t make any attacks while confused. Instead it becomes compliant, answers short questions if possible, and follows other suggestions that don’t lead directly to damaging itself or other creatures.
