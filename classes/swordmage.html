			"“My warding protects me, but it is more than just a shield. By my will and magic, it can become a deadly force, or a sheltering fortification.”"
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>Overview</b>: Content to be neither a pure warrior nor a full mage, the swordmage seeks to incorporate the best of both disciplines. Her spells and her weapon are one; raw magic is her armor. She utilizes brief phrases of power to accomplish feats no mortal could achieve with sword alone. Swordmages arise from all sorts of backgrounds and cultures, sometimes under strict training, sometimes having just picked up bits and pieces of knowledge where they were available. A master of adaptation, the swordmage is a useful resource for nearly any endeavor.<br/>
			&emsp;Magical barriers of force swirl around you, protecting you from harm. The blade you carry is an extension of your being, both body and mind. It pulses with eldritch energy as you prepare to defend your allies and unleash magical fury against your foes.<br/>
			<b>Play Style</b>: The swordmage is part melee combatant, part spellcaster. She is neither tough enough to stand against waves of enemies like the Fighter or Paladin, nor can she wreak massive devastation with awe-inspiring spells like the Wizard or Sorcerer. Instead, the swordmage shows her strength in disruption. She can protect her allies from attacks, maneuver opponents into unfortunate circumstances and buff herself to deliver precision pain to whoever happens to be on the business end of her weapon.<br/>
			&emsp;Like the Bard, the swordmage may not be a class best suited for new players. It offers a high amount of choice on each turn and makes full use of all available actions. Players who enjoy a lot of moving around and setting up conditions under which to really punish an enemy will find the swordmage a welcome addition to the 13th Age class options.<br/>
			<b>Backgrounds</b>: Here are a few sorcerer backgrounds to get you started: tribal shaman, former child avatar, pirate captain, spell-arena gladiator, failed wizard, Shadow Port city guard, sahuagin hunter.

		<h5><a id="gear"></a>Gear</h5>
		<p class="initial">
			At 1st level, a swordmages has a melee weapon which is the most important piece of gear she owns. She is emotionally and magically bonded to her weapon. A swordmage rarely wears armor heavier than leather or carries a shield since her magic covers that need. In addition, she has a slightly larger-than-normal assortment of mundane adventuring gear, generally including thieves’ tools and/or a disguise kit.
		</p>
		<p><b>Gold Pieces</b>: Swordmages may start with either 25 gp or 1d6 x 10 gp.</p>
		<p><b><a></a>Armor</b></p>
		<p>Swordmages constantly protect themselves with a magical barrier to the extent where it can continue even when they’re unconscious. It is a simple exercise for someone who can detect magic to point out a swordmage in the middle of a crowd unless the swordmage willingly dismisses the protection (-2 to AC until magical protection re-enabled). The table below shows the base AC of the swordmage while this magical protection is in effect:</p>

			<h5>Class Features</h5>

			<p class="initial">Swordmages all have the following three class features .</p>

			<h7>Warding</h7>
			<p>As a swordmage, you have learned to create and maintain a magical warding. You gain a +2 to AC (included in the class’ base AC) so long as you have one hand free and are conscious.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Your warding remains even if you fall unconscious.</p>
			<p class="odd-row"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: If your warding provides damage resistance, that resistance increases to 14+.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: The Warding feature grants a +3 to AC instead of +2 (add a +1 bonus to your base AC).</p>

			<h7>Bonded Weapon</h7>
			<p>You can spend one hour meditating on your weapon of choice, bonding with it and imbuing it with magic. As a standard action you can call it to your hand even if it is far away, and it will try its best to fly or teleport back to your hand in the quickest way possible. You cannot bond with more than one weapon (successfully bonding with a new weapon immediately discards the previous binding). In the event that the weapon is broken, as long as you have one piece of the weapon, you can call back all of its other fragments and re-forge the weapon after one hour of meditation (if there are fragments that are completely destroyed, the weapon will grow them back).</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Calling the weapon to your hand takes a quick action instead of a standard action.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: You are so intimately bonded to your weapon that a bit of your soul is permanently embedded in it. For purposes of resurrection the blade is considered a legitimate substitute for your body. Additional benefits may depend on a variety of factors.</p>

			<h7>Swordmage Spells</h7>
			<p>Swordmagess use two types of spells: invocations and power words. Invocations are spells that are easily performed, requiring only a quick action, and often enhance either the warrior or the weapon’s attacks. Most Invocations have feats associated with them. Power words are utterances in a magical language of creation that are used in conjunction with basic attacks. They have minor spell-like effects such as moving people or objects around and causing intense sensations in a target. Power words function similarly to the fighter's flexible attacks. You may only use one power word per attack.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Choose a Level 1 power word. Once per battle, you may utilize this power word on any hit that would not normally trigger that power word.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Choose a Level 3 power word. Once per battle, you may utilize this power word on any hit that would not normally trigger that power word.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Choose a Level 5 power word. Once per battle, you may utilize this power word on any hit that would not normally trigger that power word.</p>

			<h5>Class Talents</h5>

			<p class="initial">Choose 3 of the following class talents.</p>

			<h7>Magic Focus</h7>
			<p>You can not take this talent if you take Martial Focus or Evasive Focus</p>
			<p>Choose a spell of your level or lower from one of the arcane spellcasting classes (Wizard, Sorcerer, or Necromancer). You learn that spell, treating it as a swordmage spell. You can change this spell for another of the same class every time you take a full heal-up.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You may replace one of your swordmage spells with second spell from the class you chose for the base talent. You can change this spell every time you take a full heal-up.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: You gain the Adventurer feats for any spells you know because of this Talent.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Choose a spell from one of the arcane spellcasting classes you did not choose for the base talent. You may replace one of your swordmage spells with that spell. You can change this spell for another of the same class every time you take a full heal-up</p>

			<h7>Evasive Focus</h7>
			<p>You can not take this talent if you take Martial Focus or Magic Focus</p>
			<p>Choose a 1st level power from the Rogue class. You may use that power in addition to your swordmage spells so long as you meet any requirements the power has. You can change this power every time you take a full heal-up.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You may replace one of your spells with another Rogue power of your level or lower. You cant change this power every time you take a full heal-up.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion feat</i></b>: You gain the Adventurer feats for any Rogue powers you know because of this Talent.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic feat</i></b>: You may deal Sneak Attack damage as if you were a Rogue of your level once per battle when the escalation die is 3+.</p>

			<h7>Martial Focus</h7>
			<p>You can not take this talent if you take Magic Focus or Evasive Focus</p>
			<p>Choose a flexible attack from the fighter or a tactic from the commander of your level or lower. You may use that attack or power in addition to your swordmage spells so long as you meet any requirements the power has. You can change this attack or tactic for another of the same class every time you take a full heal-up.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You may replace one of your swordmage spells with another power from the class you chose for the base talent. You can change this power every time you take a full heal-up.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: You gain the Adventurer feats for any attacks you know because of this Talent.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Choose another flexible attack or tactic of at least two levels lower than you. You gain that power. The power you choose for this feat does not need to be from the same class you chose for the base talent. In addition, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and a +1/tier bonus to damage with thrown weapons</p>

			<h7>Cantrips</h7>
			<p>You can cast the same cantrips as a Wizard with the same limitation of three cantrips per day, but unlike the Wizard, your cantrips last half as long (5-30 minutes at adventurer tier, 30-180 minutes at champion tier, and 1-6 hours at epic tier).</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: You gain one additional use of a cantrip.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Your cantrips now last for the full listed duration.</p>

			<h7>Eldritch Speed</h7>
			<p>Once per battle at the start of each fight, you can take a move action before anyone’s turn starts.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: You may choose to instead use this move action for free any time during the fight.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Once per day, you can take a standard action as a quick action.</p>

			<h7>Spell Absorption</h7>
			<p>Once per battle, you can attempt to absorb the spell energy of an enemy caster. When an enemy casts an attack spell, roll a d6 as an interrupt action. If your roll is equal to the Escalation die, you harmlessly diffuse the spell. If less, you instead absorb the spell and regain the use of one of your Invocations.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: At the start of each battle, roll a d6. You may attempt to absorb a spell for free anytime the Escalation die reads the rolled value or higher.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: If you dislike the result of your diffusion roll, you may reroll it. You must use the rerolled result.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic feat</i></b>: Instead roll a d4 when you attempt to diffuse a spell.</p>

			<h7>Been There, Done That</h7>
			<p>When you make a skill check for which none of your Backgrounds apply, add +1 to the result of that skill check.</p>

			<h7>Wandering Warding</h7>
			<p>Once per battle when an enemy attacks a nearby ally, you can choose to transfer your warding to that ally as an interrupt action. In effect, that ally gains a +2 bonus to AC and you take a -2 penalty to AC. Your warding returns to you at the beginning of your next turn.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You can activate this ability twice per battle.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: You may transfer your warding freely when the Escalation die is 4 or higher.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: You may transfer your warding freely when the Escalation die is 2 or higher.</p>

			<h7>Living Blade</h7>
			<p>Once per day, you can spend a quick action to allow your weapon to move on its own for the remainder of battle while you are nearby and, if your weapon is a true magic item, if the magic item agrees to be wielded in such a manner. You can make an attack through it as a standard action. You also gain a +1 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn if your weapon remains adjacent to you and does not attack this turn. If you are far away from your weapon, it stops moving and falls to the ground.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You may animate your weapon twice per day.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: You can mentally order the weapon to make a basic attack as a quick action when the escalation die is odd. This attack cannot benefit from Power Words.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: For the duration of the battle your weapon gains intelligence (though not sentience), able to make basic attacks independent from you. It utilizes your initiative score, attack and damage bonuses and defenses. Damage dealt to it applies to your HP total. On its own, your weapon deals damage as if it were two levels lower than you.</p>
