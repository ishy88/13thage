			<b>Overview</b>: The grit and guts it takes to be a true fighter may be as rare and magical as the brains and arcane spark it takes to be a wizard. Plenty of poor slobs all across the world get pressed into military duty, and some fighters start that way, but there's more to a true fighter than that: skill, discipline, toughness, and an uncanny ability to get in harm's way ... with a double dose of harm for the other guy.<br/>
			&emsp;Fighters draw weapons for gold, for glory, for duty, and for the mere joy of unrestrained martial exercise. When you unsheathe your 
sword, what battle cry flies from your lips?<br/>
			<b>Play Style</b>: A couple of class talents can make your job more complicated, but overall, playing a fighter is simple. You decide who to attack, roll your attack, and then figure out which flexible attack you want to use.<br/>
			<b>Backgrounds</b>: Here are some backgrounds to get you started with your fighters:<br/>
			&emsp;swordmaster, mercenary captain, sea raider, shieldwall spearman, explorer, bouncer, thug, city guardsman, Sea Wall veteran, former gladiator, former orc captive, bankrupt nobleman, duelist, goblin-hunter, former Imperial legionnaire.

			<h5>Class Features</h5>

			<p class="initial">Fighters have two class features: Extra Tough and Threatening.</p>
			<p>Fighters also have flexible attacks called maneuvers; you roll your attack and then choose which maneuver you want the attack to use. You only get to use one maneuver with each attack, so it's usually best to choose maneuvers with a few different triggering rolls.</p>

			<h7>Extra Tough</h7>
			<p>You start with nine recoveries instead of the usual eight.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Increase your total number of recoveries by one.</p>

			<h7>Threatening</h7>
			<p>Whenever an enemy attempts to disengage from you, it takes a -4 penalty to its check. This penalty doesn't apply if you are stunned, grabbed, or otherwise incapable of making an opportunity attack.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Whenever an enemy fails to disengage from you, you also deal 4 damage to that enemy. (At 5th level, 8 damage. At 8th level, 12 damage.)</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Whenever a non-mook enemy fails to disengage from you, it's vulnerable to your attacks for the rest of the battle.</p>

			<h5>Class Talents</h5>

			<p class="initial">Choose three of the following class talents. You get an additional fighter class talent at 6th level.</p>

			<h7>Cleave</h7>
			<p>Once per round, make a fighter melee attack as a free action after one of your melee attacks drops a non-mook enemy to 0 hp.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: If you have your move action available, you can use it before making your Cleave attack to reach an enemy you are not already engaged with.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: If you have your move action available and are already engaged, you may pop free from one enemy to reach an enemy you are not already engaged with.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: You gain a +4 attack bonus with your Cleave attacks.</p>

			<h7>Combat Tactics</h7>
			<p>You may use flexible attacks when making an opportunity attack. Once per round when the escalation die is even, you may subtract one from your natural attack roll.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Once per battle, you may apply two different maneuvers to a flexible attack, so long as you meet their requirements.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: When you intercept an enemy, you may make an opportunity attack at a -4 penalty.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Enemies you hit with opportunity attacks are vulnerable until the end of your next turn.</p>

			<h7>Comeback Strike</h7>
			<p>Once per battle as a free action, make another attack with a –2 penalty after your first fighter attack during your turn misses.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You no longer take the -2 penalty to your Comeback Strike attacks. In addition, if your Comeback Strike attack critically hits, you do not expend its use.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: When the escalation die reaches 3, you gain one additional use of Comeback Strike. In addition, when recharging a magic armor power, roll twice and take the highest result.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: You gain a +4 attack bonus with your Comeback Strike attacks.</p>

			<h7>Counter-Attack</h7>
			<p>Once per round when an enemy misses you with a natural odd melee attack roll, you can make a basic melee attack dealing half damage against that enemy as a free action. (The attack can't use any limited abilities or flexible attack maneuvers.)</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Your Counter-Attack attack now deals full damage.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: When the escalation die is even, you can use Counter-Attack once per turn instead of once per round.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Once per battle, counter attack may trigger on a natural even miss on a melee attack roll.

			<h7>Deadeye Archer</h7>
			<p>Your attacks with d8 ranged weapons (heavy crossbow, longbow) now deal d10 damage per level. Your attacks with d6 ranged weapons (light crossbow, shortbow) now deal d8 damage per level. In addition, your misses with basic ranged attacks deal damage equal to your level.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: If you spend a quick action to aim before making a ranged basic attack, add a +5 bonus to the damage if you miss.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Once per battle, expand your crit range with a fighter ranged attack by 4 (usually to 16+) for that attack.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Your crit range with ranged weapon attacks expands by 1 (usually to 19+).</p>

			<h7>Heavy Warrior</h7>
			<p>Once per battle, when you are hit by an attack that targets AC, as a free action, you can take half damage from that attack instead.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: When the escalation die reaches 3, you gain an additional use of Heavy Warrior. You can also use this talent against an attack that targets PD.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Whenever you use Heavy Warrior, you may immediately roll to recharge your magic armor's power (if any). Add the escalation die to this roll.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: You can also use the power against an attack that targets MD.</p>

			<h7>Power Attack</h7>
			<p>Once per battle, when you hit with an attack, you may deal extra damage to the target of that attack equal to 1d4 damage per level if you are using a one-handed weapon, or 1d6 damage per level with a two-handed weapon.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You may also choose to deal the additional Power Attack damage on a missed attack. When you deal damage to an enemy with Power Attack, you may choose to pop it free from all creatures.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: When the escalation die reaches 3, you gain one additional use of Power Attack.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: One-handed weapon damage using Power Attack increases to 1d6 per level; two-handed weapon damage using Power Attack increases to 1d8 per level.</p>

			<h7>Preparation</h7>
			<p>You can generate the effect of any maneuver that you know which requires a missed attack roll as a standard action instead of making a flexible melee attack to see which maneuver you are able to trigger.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</b></i>: Once per battle, if the escalation die is 3 or higher, you may use Preparation as a move action.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Once per battle, if the escalation die is 5 or higher, you may use Preparation as a quick action.</p>

			<h7>Skilled Intercept</h7>
			<p>Once per round as a free action, roll a save (11+) to make an enemy moving to attack one of your allies attack you instead. Take half damage from this attack if you are wearing heavy armor.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>:: You gain a bonus to your Skilled Intercept save equal to the escalation die.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Once per battle, you can take no damage from the moving enemy's attack.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: You gain a +4 bonus to your Skilled Intercept save.</p>

			<h7>Tough as Iron</h7>
			<p>Once per battle, you can rally using a quick action instead of a standard action.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Once per day, you can rally twice during a battle as a quick action, without needing to roll a save for the second rally.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Increase your total number of recoveries by 2.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: When you roll a natural 18+ with an attack, you gain an additional use of Tough As Iron this battle.</p>
