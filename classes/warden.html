		<p>
			<b>Overview</b>: Stories tell of some champions who serve or oppose the Icons—not through “borrowed” spells or magic; nor through mortal grit, training, or luck; but from a seemingly inherent supernatural strength, stamina, and force of arms. These stories (the mostly true ones, anyway) are talking about the warden.<br/>
			&emsp;A warden might be the blood relative of an Icon or fearsome monsters like giants. They may have been enchanted at infancy,  blessed after a unique initiation, or returned from seeming death with renewed purpose and power. Other wardens are brought by the Icons seemingly from nowhere, from across the sea or beyond the wastes, to join in their conflicts. And many say that the attention of an Icon can warp reality to create a warden—that the belief that there exists a person who champions or threatens that Icon can empower a being to make it so.<br/>
			&emsp;Primal power waits in the ground beneath your feet, surges with every beat of your heart, and flows through your lungs with every breath. The world cries out to you, calling for a champion to defend it. Will you heed its call?<br/>
			<b>Play Style</b>: The warden is a bit of a challenge to play thanks to Greatness powers that depend heavily on whether you last hit an enemy or were hit yourself, as well as the management of the many warden powers that are daily or recharge resources. The class can be very engaging for the player who wants a “tough” character with a lot of choices during play.<br/>
			<b>Backgrounds</b>: Here are some backgrounds to get you started with your wardens:<br/>
			&emsp;Child of giants, enchanted by the Sorceress that raised you, warrior from across the sea, raised as the child of a god, commander of an imperial legion, infamous killer.

			<h5>Class Features</h5>

			<p class="initial">Wardens have the following class features.</p>

			<h7>Greatness</h7>
			<p>Greatness represents the belief in your power during the ups and downs of battle. Many of the warden’s powers function only when the warden has greatness. Greatness is either on or off&mdash;you either have greatness, or you don’t. The default is that you do not start a battle with greatness. You gain greatness when you are hit by an enemy attack. You lose greatness when you miss all enemies with an attack. You also lose greatness when you become unconscious, and when a battle ends.<br/>
			&emsp;By default you can use greatness powers without losing greatness, but a few powers specify that you must spend your greatness to use them. You don’t have to use attacks that require greatness against the foe you were hit by to gain that greatness. Greatness powers that do not require you to spend your greatness are generally classified as interrupt actions. You can only use one interrupt action a round, which keeps your greatness powers from dominating the battle.</p>

			<h7>Empowered by Fate</h7>
			<p>You gain 1 relationship point with the Archmage, the Crusader, the Dwarf King, the Emperor, the Lich King, the Priestess, or the Three; you choose whether the point is positive, conflicted, or negative. This point can add to your normal relationship points but you can’t exceed the normal relationship maximums with it. When an ally rolls a 5 or a 6 on an icon relationship roll with the Icon(s) this feature gave you a relationship point with, start the next turn in battle with greatness.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: When you roll a 5 or a 6 on a relationship roll with the icon from this feature, start the next round in battle with greatness.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Gain another relationship point with one of the above icons. As above, you must follow the relationship maximums.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Gain another relationship point with one of the above icons. This point can exceed the relationship maximums.</p>

			<h7>Strength of Many</h7>
			<p>You can lift twice and support about as much weight as two otherwise identical creatures normally can, and can move normally while carrying about your own weight (or twice your weight total). You also gain the use of <i>power stunt</i>.</p>
			<p><i>Power stunt</i>: At the start of each battle, roll a d6. Any time after the escalation die reaches that number, you’ll be able to use a quick action to spend your greatness and execute a power stunt. Normally you can only use power stunt once per battle, but circumstances, geography, or excellent planning may suggest that you can pull it off more than once.<br/>
			&emsp;Power stunts are improvisational effects that play off your preternatural strength. Things like muscling an enemy out of your may or leaping over the head of that enemy, knocking a stalactite onto your opponent, forcing a foe onto a soggy patch of ground that slows them down, wedging your enemy’s sword into a stone floor, busting open a barrel of lamp oil into the eyes or under the feet of incoming foes, shaking the tree that brings the sniper that thought he was out of reach crashing down to earth, etc. Power stunt effects are something any strong character might be able to accomplish, except you do not to make a check while using power stunt. Gaining increased strength by spending feats on this feature may allow you to describe more incredible effects for power stunt, affecting more or larger foes.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You instead lift, support, and move normally with a total of about five times the normal amount. Also, roll an additional d20 for power stunt (any time after the escalation die reaches that number, gain an additional use of power stunt this battle).</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: You instead lift, support, and move normally with a total of about ten times the normal amount. Roll an additional d12 for power stunt instead of a d20.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: You instead lift, support, and move normally with a total of thirty or more times the normal amount.  Roll an additional d6 for power stunt instead of a d12.</p>

			<h7>Unarmed Attacks</h7>
			<p>Warden unarmed attacks are light weapons that do 1d6 plus any applicable modifiers.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: When your natural melee attack roll equals the number currently showing on the escalation die, you can make an immediate basic unarmed melee attack against the same enemy as a free action.</p>

			<h5>Class Talents</h5>

			<p class="initial">Choose three of the following class talents.</p>

			<h7>Colossal Stamina</h7>
			<p>Your base HP value is now 12.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Your recovery value is 11 while you have greatness.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Your recovery value is always 11.</p>

			<h7>Confidence</h7>
			<p>You are always affected by fear effects as if you were at full HP, and gain greatness when you successfully resist a fear effect.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Gain a +2 to MD.</p>

			<h7>Godslayer</h7>
			<p>When you hit an enemy that has more hit points than you with an attack, increase the damage of that attack by your level.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Once per battle, instead increase the damage by twice your level.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Once per day, instead increase the damage by five times their level.</p>

			<h7>Legion of One</h7>
			<p>When you are hit by an attack from an enemy with fewer hit points than you, reduce that attacks damage by your level.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Once per battle, instead reduce the damage by twice your level.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Once per day, instead reduce the damage by five times your level.</p>

			<h7>Limbs of Iron</h7>
			<p>You gain a +2 bonus to AC when wearing no armor. In addition, when you miss with a ranged basic attack it deals damage equal to your level.</p>

			<h7>Stride the World</h7>
			<p>You gain resistance 16+ to two of Cold, Fire, or Poison. You are vulnerable to the other type.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You lose the vulnerability.</p>

			<h7>Titan Grapple</h7>
			<p>You can grab a creature using the normal grab rules, with a successful 5 + level vs. PD attack as a standard action.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: If you wish, you move and are moved when grabbed or grabbing as if you were one size larger.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: If you wish, instead you move and are moved when grabbed or grabbing as if you were two sizes larger.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: If you wish, you can move any creature when grabbing it, and cannot be moved by any creature grabbing you.</p>

			<h7>Weapons of Giants</h7>
			<p>You wield, forge, or improvise oversized weapons. While you have greatness, increase your weapon and unarmed damage dice by one step.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Instead, increase your weapon and unarmed damage dice by one step whether or not you have greatness.</p>
