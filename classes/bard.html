		<p class="initial subtitle">
			"The clash of blades, a note. A battle fought, a verse. The hero's war, a song."
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>Overview</b>: Bards are artists first and foremost, and they practice magic just as they practice song, drama, or poetry. They have a clear sense of how people perceive reality, so they master charm magic and some illusions. Sagas of great heroes are part of a bard's repertoire, and most bards follow the example of many fables and become skilled in a variety of fields. A bard's artistic ability, knowledge of lore, and arcane might are widely respected, particularly among the world's rulers.<br/>
			&emsp;Art and magic share a sublime beauty, and, as a bard, you seek the place where the two meet. You might be a naturally talented wanderer who casts impressive spells almost instinctively, a student of a bardic college who learned ordered systems of magic and epic poetry, a warrior skald who mixes skill at arms with thundering music, a dashing performer known for putting on a good show even for your enemies, or a perfectionist who seeks the consummate formula that blends art and magic into a higher force.<br/>
			&emsp;A steady rhythm beats in the back of your mind as you brandish your sword. Your eyes and ears pick up the motion of the villains that surround you, and one glance tells you everything you need to know to defeat them. You whistle three staccato notes, letting your allies know the symphony of battle is about to begin.<br/>
			<b>Play Style</b>: Bards are flexible characters with many options in roleplaying situations and in combat. They’re not the best character choice for beginning players, but can be a lot of fun for experienced and extroverted players who enjoy mastering different types of abilities and performing as jacks or jills of all trades.<br/>
			<b>Backgrounds</b>: Music, swordplay, and arcana offer diverse paths that lead to becoming a bard. If you’re stuck for inspiration after the
sample backgrounds that follow, look at the sample lists for fighters, rogues, sorcerers, and wizards&mdash;most could apply.<br/>
			&emsp;Possible backgrounds include wandering minstrel, cathedral musician, court jester, mercenary, tavern owner, failed hedge wizard, diplomat, spy, royal taster, caravan guide, smuggler, and battle skald.

			<h5>Class Features</h5>

			<h7 class="initial">Versatile Combatant</h7>
			<p>At first level, a bard chooses one of the following. Barring exceptional circumstances, this decision cannot be changed throughout their career, as with talents:</p>
			<div class="indent">
				<p>&bull; +1 to all weapon attack rolls, +1/tier to weapon damage rolls</p>
				<p>&bull; +1 to all spell and song attack rolls, +1/tier to spell and song damage rolls</p>
			</div>

			<h7>Bardic Songs</h7>
			<p>Bardic songs last for one or more rounds and end with a final verse that carries a big payoff. Although magical, bardic songs don't count as spells; they don't force the bard to suffer opportunity attacks from engaged enemies, and they can't be canceled by effects that can cancel spells. In fact, bards can cast spells while in the middle of singing a bardic song.</p>
			<p>Each song specifies what type of action starts it. To sustain it during the next round, it requires an action and a d20 check against its sustain target. If successful, the song can continue with its sustained effect for that round. (The next round will require another sustain check.) If your attempt to sustain a song fails, the song's final verse effect resolves immediately, and then the song's power ends. You can start another song on your next round.</p>
			<p>You don't have to try to sustain the song at the start of your turn. If you choose not to sustain a song, its effects end immediately and you choose whether to use the song's final verse effect in the current round or to start a new song. You can't do both.</p>
			<p>Some songs have an immediate effect that happens each time you start or sustain the song. Others have effects that continue throughout the entire round.</p>
			<p>Most songs stop when a bard is knocked unconscious, silenced, or stunned. Having your song stopped this way prevents you from getting the final verse effect.</p>
			<p>You can only sing one bardic song at a time. If you are singing a song (or spend an action to try to sustain a song), you can't start another song that round.</p>
			<p>Bardic songs are loud, and cancel any of stealth effects you may have.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Your bardic songs don't stop immediately when you are knocked unconscious, stunned, or silenced. Instead, they continue for one round, giving you the chance to sustain the song on your next turn.</p>

			<h7>Battle Cries</h7>
			<p>Bards use battle cries to encourage, inspire, warn, and magically aid their allies. Battle cries are triggered by flexible melee attacks. The bard makes a melee attack and is able to use a battle cry that corresponds to the attack's natural result, sometimes whether or not the attack hits.</p>
			<p>Bonuses provided by battle cries can help a bard's allies but not the bard.</p>
			<p class="odd-row" style="width:40%; margin: 0 15px"><b>Adventurer Feat</b>: You can generate the effect of any 1st or 3rd level battle cry you know as a standard action (instead of making a flexible melee attack to see which battle cry you are able to trigger). This allows you to choose the particular battle cry you want, at the expense of taking your standard action.</p>

			<h7>Spells</h7>
			<p>Bards use arcane spells that function like those of other spell-casting classes. Some spells are daily, some recharge, and others are at-will.</p>

			<h5>Class Talents</h5>

			<p class="initial">Choose three of the following class talents.</p>

			<h7>Balladeer</h7>
			<p>At each level, including 1st level, you may learn a great ballad of your choice. Each day you can sing one of these songs to give you a positive relationship with an icon that you would not ordinarily have as well as increasing a negative relationship with another icon.</p>
			<p>Song choices for the great ballad are up to the role-player.</p>
			<p>It takes at least a few rounds to sing a great ballad, so ideally it happens outside of combat. As you sing the ballad, it's an opportunity to tell the GM what's special about the story you are telling.</p>
			<p>Make a skill check using your best singing or musical background. If you succeed, you gain 2 points of positive relationship with the chosen icon for the rest of the day (until the next full heal-up). The DC depends on the environment:</p>
			<p>&emsp;DC 10: Adventurer environment</p>
			<p>&emsp;DC 15: Champion environment</p>
			<p>&emsp;DC 20: Epic environment</p>
			<p>You can use these points to roll relationship dice the way you roll your normal icon relationships (see Icon Relationships). If you already have positive or conflicted dice with the icon you've sung about, add them to your new bonus dice. If you have negative dice with the icon you've sung a ballad to, they can be temporarily overruled by the ballad, but the GM should feel free to interpret any 5s rolled with a heavy hand.</p>
			<p>When your great ballad magically compliments an icon, another icon should take a hit. As you explain the story of your ballad to the GM, you should account for at least one icon who is being mocked, vilified, or referred to in unflattering terms. You get an equal number of cursed dice for that icon. Cursed dice aren't like negative relationship dice—they never help you. At the GM's option, you'll have to roll these cursed dice at least once and interpret them as possible problems for you: rolls of 1 are a definite problem; rolls of 2 mean there are story complications connected to the temporary enemy icon.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: The first time you use your ballad-created relationship, any 5s you roll become 6s. You also gain a +2 bonus to your Balladeer checks.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: You can sing two great songs a day. You can't sing positively about an icon that you've already sung about as an enemy earlier in the day.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: If you are willing to gain an equal number of cursed relationship dice with all of the listed enemies for a song, increase the positive bonus dice you gain from a successful ballad to 3 or 4.</p>

			<h7>Battle Skald</h7>
			<p>You cannot take this talent if you have taken the <i>Spellsinger</i> talent.</p>
			<p>Increase the number of battle cries you know by one. The bonus battle cry can be from your highest possible level. In addition, you do not suffer a penalty to attack when wielding a shield.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: When the escalation die is odd, you can use your battle cries to help yourself. When the escalation die is odd, you may also subtract one from the natural rolls of your battle cries.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: When you use a battle cry on yourself, it also helps an ally.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: You gain a +1 bonus to AC and PD. When the escalation die is 6, you can use your battle cries to help yourself.</p>

			<h7>Jack of Spells</h7>
			<p>Choose Cleric, Necromancer, Sorceror, or Wizard. You can choose one spell from the spell list (but not the talent list) of that class, of your own level or lower, as an extra spell you know how to cast. Use your spell attack bonus - 1 to determine any effects of the spell, including attack and damage. You can even take its feats up to your tier, if it has any. You may only choose from the spell list, not from talents.</p>
			<p>This spell is a bonus spell, not included in your bard class count.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You use your spell attack bonus, instead of your spell attack bonus -1, to determine the effects of the spell.<br/>
			If the spell is a wizard spell, you also gain three cantrips of your choice from the wizard. You can cast them like a wizard who lacks the Cantrip Mastery talent.<br/>
			If you choose a spell from the sorcerer class, you also gain the sorcerer's dancing lights class feature.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Choose a second spell-casting class. Gain a spell from that class as well.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Choose a third spell-casting class. Gain a spell from that class as well.</p>

			<h7>Mythkenner</h7>
			<p>Take a single point of relationship with an icon. Add the point to a relationship you already have up to your normal maximum, or start a new one—positive, conflicted, or negative.</p>
			<p>Choose one:</p>
			<div class="indent">
				<p>&bull; Take two additional points of backgrounds. You can use these additional points to raise a background that has something to do with history, bardic lore, or magical knowledge up to the usually impossible rating of +6.</p>
				<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You gain +1 bonus to all skill checks relating to history, bardic lore, or magical knowledge.</p>
				<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: The bonus increases to +2, and you gain an additional point of relationship with the Archmage or Lich King.</p>
				<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: The bonus increases to +4, and you gain an additional point of relationship with the Archmage or Lich King. You may go beyond the maximum relationship allowed for these icons.</p>
				<p>&bull; Take two additional points of backgrounds. You can use these additional points to raise a background that has something to do with religion, mythology, or history up to the usually impossible rating of +6.</p>
				<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You gain +1 bonus to all skill checks relating to religion, mythology, or history.</p>
				<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: The bonus increases to +2, and you gain an additional point of relationship with the Priestess or the Great Gold Worm.</p>
				<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: The bonus increases to +4, and you gain an additional point of relationship with the Priestess or the Great Gold Worm. You may go beyond the maximum relationship allowed for these icons.</p>
			</div>

			<h7>Songmaster</h7>
			<p>When you attempt to maintain a bardic song, if you describe it in a fashion that entertains the GM, or at least a couple of the players, you get a bonus of +1 to +3 to maintain the song.</p>
			<p>This talent is for those that enjoy improvisation.</p>

			<h7>Spellsinger</h7>
			<p>You cannot take this talent if you have taken the <i>Battle Skald</i> talent.</p>
			<p>You can choose an extra bardic song or bard spell at the highest level you know. When you use a daily bard spell, you gain a +1 bonus to sustain rolls for the rest of the battle. This bonus is cumulative.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: While at least one of your bardic songs is active, you and nearby allies gain a +1 bonus to PD and MD.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: When the escalation die is odd and you successfully sustain a bardic song, you may choose to end your bardic song without generating the final verse effect. In return, you regain the use of the bardic song, but you cannot active a new bardic song this turn.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: You gain a +1 bonus to sustain rolls for your bardic songs. You may have two active bardic songs at a time, but you must sustain each one separately.</p>

			<h7>Storyteller</h7>
			<p>Once per scene when one of your allies rolls relationship dice for an icon, you can roleplay a one or two sentence story (usually related to the icon, but perhaps otherwise pivotal) that allows them to reroll the relationship check if they don't like the first result.</p>
