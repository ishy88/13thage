		<p>
			<b>Overview</b>: Wizards are the masters of arcane energy. They use geometry, symbology, occult numerology, and a complex grammatical system to describe magic and thereby control it. They fill their heavy, locked spellbooks with crabbed writing, secret codes, and convoluted designs.<br/>
			&emsp;Each wizard belongs to a school or at least a lineage, traced back from student to master. Today, many wizard schools are aligned directly with the Archmage, but most are independent. Thanks to interlocking treaties among schools, most wizards from rival schools are sworn to respect each other. This restriction, however, seems to stoke competition rather than quell it.<br/>
			&emsp;Many “book-wizards” are more-or-less cowards who would rather study reality than experience it. The wizards that go adventuring are the rare sort who respond to mortal danger with greater focus rather than panic.<br/>
			&emsp;A cloak of spells enfolds you, ancient rituals bolster your senses, and runed implements of your craft hang from your belt. Effervescing arcane lore pulses  through your consciousness, a constant pressure   craving release. When will you know enough magic to  storm the ramparts of reality itself?<br/>
			<b>Play Style</b>: Our wizard is designed for experienced players who like a bit of improvisation. Most of the wizard’s spells can only be used once per day, so timing matters. If you want to play the simplest possible wizard, choose the Abjuration and Familiar talents. To play as the flexible spellcaster who finds unique and amusing answers to problems, choose Cantrip Mastery, High Arcana, and Polysyllabic Verbalizations.<br/>
			<b>Backgrounds</b>: Possible backgrounds include: magical prodigy, spell thief, hedge wizard, transformed familiar, ship’s wizard, royal poisoner.

		</div>

		<div id="class-features" class="tabcontent" style="display: block">
			<h5>Class Features</h5>

			<p class="initial">Wizards have three class features: Cantrips, Cyclic Spells, and Ritual Magic.</p>

			<h7>Cantrips</h7>
			<p>Every wizard can cast a handful of cantrips each day. You don’t have to memorize or choose them beforehand, you just cast them on the fly. Wizards can cast 5 cantrips each battle. Each cantrip takes a standard action to cast as a ranged spell. Outside of battle, a wizard can cast about three to six cantrips every five minutes. The Cantrip Mastery talent speeds up cantrip casting.</p>
			<p>At the adventurer tier (levels 1–4), cantrips with a standard duration last 10–60 minutes, plus 10 minutes per wizard level. The GM rolls and the wizard becomes aware that their cantrip is about to end a couple minutes before it’s done.</p>
			<p>At the champion tier, levels 5–7, most cantrips last 1–6 hours.</p>
			<p>At the epic tier, levels 8–10, cantrips last between 2–12 hours.</p>
			<p>For a list of available cantrips, see Spells.</p>

			<h7>Cyclic Spells</h7>
			<p>Spells that have a cyclic usage can always be cast at least once per battle, and are only expended in that battle if they are cast when the escalation die is 0 or odd. In other words, if you cast a cyclic spell like color spray or rebuke when the escalation die is even, the spell is not expended and can still be cast later in the battle.</p>

			<h7>Ritual Magic</h7>
			<p>Take two additional points of backgrounds in a background that has to do with high arcana or magical knowledge.</p>

			<h5>Class Talents</h5>

			<p class="initial">Choose three of the following class talents.</p>

			<h7>Abjuration</h7>
			<p>Whenever you cast a daily wizard spell, you gain a +4 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: The bonus also applies to PD and MD.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to twice your level whenever you cast a daily wizard spell.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Whenever you cast a daily wizard spell, you gain resistance to all damage 16+ until the start of your next turn.</p>

			<h7>Cantrip Mastery</h7>
			<p>Cantrips are at-will spells for you. Unlike normal wizards, who use a standard action to cast a cantrip, you can cast a cantrip as a quick action.<br/>
			&emsp;To do something particularly cunning or surprising with one of your cantrips where the GM isn’t sure whether you could pull off that use of the spell, roll a normal save (11+) to cast the spell the way you envision it. Additionally, you can expend a 3rd level spell slot or higher to choose one cantrip per spell slot you have given up and create a once-per-day related effect with it that is much greater, if you and your GM can agree on a cool effect that suits the cantrip.</p>

			<h7>Control</h7>
			<p>Enemies suffer a penalty to saves against your wizard spells equal to the escalation die.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: Increase the HP threshold (if any) of your wizard spells by 1/4</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: Once per battle, when an enemy would fail a save against one of your wizard spells, you may immediately roll to recharge one of your wizard spells.</p>

			<h7>High Arcana</h7>
			<p>Your study of the highest orders of magic gives you options that lesser wizards cannot match: Memorization and a bonus spell: counter-magic</p>
			<p><i>Memorization</i>: When you pick your spells, you can choose any daily wizard spell twice (instead of once). This doesn’t apply to spells that start as recharge spells. For example, at 7th level when you have five 7th level spells and four 5th level spells, you could choose fireball twice as a 7th level spell, or once as a 7th level spell and once as a 5th level spell. (Your 3rd level spell slot can’t be used for fireball because fireball starts as a 5th level spell.)</p>
			<p>
				<b>Counter-magic</b><br/>
				Close-quarters spell<br/>
				Once per battle<br/>
				Free action to cast<br/>
				<b>Trigger</b>: A nearby creature you can see casts a spell.<br/>
				<b>Target</b>: The nearby creature casting a spell.<br/>
				<b>Attack</b>: 5 + Level vs. MD<br/>
				<b>Hit</b>: The target’s spell is canceled, and the caster loses the action they were using for the spell. If the spell had a limited use, that use is expended if your natural attack roll is even.<br/>
			</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: You can now cast counter-magic twice per battle.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: You can now cast counter-magic in reaction to a creature using any magical ability, not just casting a spell.</p>

			<h7>Imbue Item</h7>
			<p>When you cast a daily wizard spell, you may attempt to recharge one of your items as a free action.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You gain a +1 bonus to recharge rolls with magic items.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: The bonus increases to +2.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: The bonus increases to +4.</p>

			<h7>Polysyllabic Verbalizations</h7>
			<p>Rename each of your daily and recharge spells. Think up the most over-the-top and extravagant names you can muster. Since these alternate spells are so lengthy, they take an additional quick action to cast. While the regular effects of the spells are the same as the more common versions, they have a small bonus effect appropriate to the situation. The bonus effect is determined by the GM, or by a collaboration between the GM and the player. It should add to the storytelling power of the situation. The bonus effect should suit the name of the spell or the way it’s delivered, and shouldn’t precisely match up with what the spell normally accomplishes.</p>

			<h7>Spell Recall</h7>
			<p>Once per day, you may lose two recoveries to regain the use of an expended daily spell.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: You may use Spell Recall a second time each day.</p>

			<h7>War Mage</h7>
			<p>Once per battle, when you would roll to determined how many targets are affected by a spell, you may instead affect the maximum number of targets possible.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b>: You gain a +1 bonus to AC and PD.</p>
			<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b>: You may use War Mage a second time when the escalation die is 3+.</p>
			<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Feat</i></b>: Your bonus to AC and PD increases to +2.</p>

			<h7>Wizard’s Familiar</h7>
			<p>Your familiar is a tiny or small animal or creature that aids your magic and provides companionship. It also provides opportunities for improvisation between you and the GM.Your familiar is as intelligent as a normal person. It can communicate with you and will stay close you unless you’ve chosen abilities that let it roam. Your familiar is on your side but it’s not perfectly in your control.<br/>
			&emsp;If your familiar dies, it can come back to you the next time you get a full heal-up. (The method or story used is between you and the GM.) Alternatively, you can get a new familiar. Familiars are useless in combat, except as indicated by their abilities. Ordinarily they aren’t damaged by enemy attacks and spells unless the story calls for it.</p>
			<p><i>Familiar Abilities</i>: Choose two of the following abilities for your familiar.</p>
			<div class="indent">
				<p><b>Agile</b>: You gain a +2 bonus to Quick skill checks.</p>
				<p><b>Alert, Maybe Even Insightful</b>: You gain a +2 bonus to Careful skill checks.</p>
				<p><b>Counter-bite</b>: Each battle, if your familiar is close to you, it bites the first enemy that hits you with a melee attack after that attack, dealing 1d4 damage per level (no attack roll) to that enemy.</p>
				<p><b>Flight</b>: Your familiar flies as well as a hawk. It doesn’t fly that often and usually sticks with you, but it can do so when its other abilities allow.</p>
				<p><b>Mimic</b>: One battle per day, you gain the use of the racial power (without feats) of one nearby ally.</p>
				<p><b>Poisonous</b>: Once per battle, when you hit an enemy engaged with you, you can add 5 ongoing poison damage per tier to the damage roll.</p>
				<p><b>Scout</b>: Once per day, your familiar can separate itself from you and make a reconnaissance run of an area or location. Roll an easy skill check for the environment to get your familiar to scout unseen.</p>
				<p><b>Tough</b>: You gain a +1 save bonus. Tough counts as two familiar abilities.</p>
				<p><b>Talkative</b>: Your familiar can talk like a person (but the GM speaks for the familiar more than you do).</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div id="spells" class="tabcontent">
			<h5>Cantrips</h5>
			<p>
				<h7>Alarm (standard duration)</h7>
				<p>The cantrip creates a minor watch-sprite that can be instructed to scream if someone comes through an area or touches an object. Watch-sprites are notoriously stupid and sleepy, but with the right talking-to they might stay focused for the duration of the spell. At higher levels, the spell might summon little fanged spirits buzzing back and forth serving as both visual and actual deterrents.</p>
			</p>
			<p>
				<h7>Arcane Mark (standard duration)</h7>
				<p>The cantrip creates a magical sigil on an object or person. These sigils are usually plain to see, though a deliberately invisible mark can be made. It takes a difficult perception or magic check to notice.</p>
			</p>
			<p>
				<h7>Ghost Sound</h7>
				<p>This spell creates false noises emanating from somewhere nearby. The effect is like an exceptionally good version of throwing your voice, if your voice could create a wide variety of sounds. Attempted distractions with the cantrip are DC 15 challenges in adventurer environments, higher as you move into champion and epic environments. If someone is using ghost sound against the PCs, a skill check can identify the sound as a magical fake.</p>
			</p>
			<p>
				<h7>Knock</h7>
				<p>This cantrip summons a magical servitor three to four times as big as your closed fist that swarms around the door and attempts to punch or push it open (depending on whether you want to be quiet or announce your presence). Success is determined with an Clever check against the environment’s DC using an appropriate magical background. This cantrip does nothing to avoid any traps that might exist.</p>
			</p>
			<p>
				<h7>Light (standard duration)</h7>
				<p>This cantrip creates a fairly wide and consistent field of light, up to 30 feet in diameter, though it isn’t bright enough to dazzle.</p>
			</p>
			<p>
				<h7>Mage Hand</h7>
				<p>This cantrip creates a small telekinetic effect that lasts a round at most. At best it’s about half as strong as the wizard’s own strongest hand. At worst it’s half as strong as the wizard when they’re weak from a bad fever.</p>
			</p>
			<p>
				<h7>Mending</h7>
				<p>This cantrip summons a variety of tiny (hand-sized and smaller) magical sprites who swarm over a chosen broken object attempting to mend it (over the course of 1–6 rounds). Small-scale repairs like torn wineskins, muddy clothing, a broken handgrip on a sword, and similar repairs that anyone could fix with two to four hours of devoted work gets handled in seconds. More elaborate repairs to complicated objects might require a Clever check, or at the GM’s discretion could only be possible if the wizard has taken the Cantrip Mastery talent.</p>
			</p>
			<p>
				<h7>Prestidigitation</h7>
				<p>This cantrip produces magic tricks and small illusions. One casting usually gives you a minute of fun. The magic has nowhere near as much real world force as mage hand.</p>
			</p>
			<p>
				<h7>Spark</h7>
				<p>This is a minor fire creation spell, enough to light a pipe, or a campfire, or even a page or two of an unprotected spellbook. It doesn’t work against living beings or against things that couldn’t easily be set on fire with a few seconds of steady application of a candle. The target of the spark has to be nearby and in sight.</p>
			</p>

			<h5>Utility Spell</h5>
			<p>When you choose spells during a full heal-up, instead of taking a standard spell, you can choose to give up a spell slot to memorize the utility spell at the same level. When you take the utility spell, you gain access to a range of useful non-combat spells of the level you memorized it or below. You cast each utility spell at the level of the spell slot you gave up for it. You can give up multiple spell slots to take utility spell multiple times.</p>
			<p>When you cast the utility spell, choose one of the following spell effects:</p>

			<p>
				<h7>1st Level Utility: Disguise Self</h7><br/>
				Close-quarters spell<br/>
				Daily<br/>
				<b>Effect</b>: This spell provides you with an effective magical disguise that lasts about ten minutes, making the skill check to avoid unmasking one step easier: easy if it would have been a normal task, normal if it would have been a hard task, and hard if it would have been a ridiculously hard task. The spell only affects your general appearance, not your size. It can be used to hide your features behind the generic features of another person or race. Using it to impersonate a specific creature makes it less effective as a disguise (-2 to -5 penalty).<br/>
				<p>3rd level spell: The spell lasts for 1 hour.</p>
				<p>5th level spell: The spell also provides smell; +2 bonus to any checks.</p>
