		<div id="attributes" class="tabcontent" style="display: block">
			<h3>Choose Your Attributes</h3>
			<p>Three basic attributes are used to describe a character: <b>Warrior</b>, <b>Rogue</b>, and <b>Mage</b>. Each attribute is usually ranked from 0 to 6, but veteran characters may have higher values.</p>
			<p>A character with a high rank in Warrior is a born fighter: strong, tough, and fearless. Characters with a low rank in this attribute will be weaker and less daring. Someone with a high Rogue attribute is cunning, stealthy, and quick on their feet, but a low Rogue attribute means the character is clumsy and inept. A highly ranked Mage attribute is a sign of intelligence, strength of will, and mental discipline, whereas a low Mage attribute means the character is dull, flighty, and easily influenced.</p>
			<p>Each player character starts with 6 attribute levels that may be freely distributed among the three attributes. Starting characters may not raise any of their attributes above 4. While highly specialized characters are possible, a well-rounded character with a few levels in each attribute probably works best for most players.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="class" class="tabcontent">
			<h3>Choose a Class</h3>
			<p>Every character has a class (see <a href="#classes">Classes</a>). Pick one.</p>
			<p>The classes are <a href="#classes/ardent">Ardent</a>, <a href="#classes/battlemind">Battlemind</a>, <a href="#classes/berserker">Berserker</a>, <a href="#classes/commander">Commander</a>, <a href="#classes/druid">Druid</a>, <a href="#classes/fighter">Fighter</a>, <a href="#classes/monk">Monk</a>, <a href="#classes/psion">Psion</a>, <a href="#classes/rogue">Rogue</a>, <a href="#classes/runepriest">Runepriest</a>, <a href="#classes/sentinel">Sentinel</a>, <a href="#classes/shaman">Shaman</a>, <a href="#classes/warden">Warden</a>, and <a href="#classes/tempest">Tempest</a>.</p>

			<h7>Multiclassing</h7>
			<p>Characters who are full members of multiple classes do not exist in this system. Instead, a few classes have talents that let them borrow from other classes. If you wish to dabble further in the exploits of another class, speak with your GM. They may decide to implement the optional born to battle heritage feat listed below.</p>
			<div class="indent">
				<p><b>Born to Battle [Heritage]</b></p>
				<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Tier</i></b>: You may give up one of your class’ three talents to gain the use of two powers from another class at your level or lower. You cannot exchange a talent for powers granted by talents. (For example, you can take the rogue’s flying blade and deadly thrust powers, but not the murderous or shadow walk talents.) You can use these powers as if you were a PC of that class at the same level. Any class requirements for using a power come with the talent. For example, if you take rogue powers that require momentum, your character uses momentum rules just as a rogue does. In addition, you may improve your choices by taking feats related to those powers up to your tier.</p>
				<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Tier</i></b>: Gain an additional power from the same class.</p>
				<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Tier</i></b>: Gain another power from the same class.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div id="backgrounds" class="tabcontent">
			<h3>Assign Background Points</h3>
			<p>Backgrounds represent pieces of your character’s history that contributes to your character’s history as well as their ability to succeed with non-combat skills.</p>
			<p>Each character has a 8 background points at first level, plus any more your class may award.. These are broad categories of experience (cat burglar, for example) rather than specific implementations of that experience (climbing and hiding). Assign your background points to as many backgrounds as you want, up to your total points. You can assign a maximum of 5 points to a single background (and minimum of 1).</p>

			<h7>Choosing Your Backgrounds</h7>
			<p>Choose backgrounds that help you make sense of your characters past, jobs, and settings. Background and skill use is meant to be about fun in-character methods of attempting to advance the plot.</p>
			<p>A few possible backgrounds include: acrobat, alchemist, animal trainer, architect, aristocratic noble, assassin, chef, con-woman, goblin exterminator, hunted outlaw, knight errant, priest, refugee, scout, shepherd, soldier, spy, temple acolyte, thief, torturer, transformed animal, traveling martial arts pupil, tribal healer, tunnel scout, wandering minstrel, warrior poet, and so on.</p>

			<h7>Making Skill Checks</h7>
			<p>When you roll a skill check to find out if you succeed at a task or trick, the GM tells you what you are rolling to attempt. Then you choose the background you think is relevant to gain the points you have in that background as a bonus to the skill check. Most skill checks require you to equal or beat a Difficulty Class (DC), set by the environment you are operating in, to succeed. If you beat the DC by less than 5, you succeed, but the DM may choose to impose additional costs.</p>
			<p>To make a skill check, use this formula:</p>
			<p>&emsp;<i>D20 + level + relevant background points + relevant attribute + other bonuses</i> vs <i>DC set by the environment</i></p>
			<p>You can’t apply multiple backgrounds to the same check; the background with the highest (or tied for highest) bonus applies. Additionally, GMs should feel free to allow a player to use some fraction of the points invested in a particular background if it seems as though the background may be related, but not strongly enough to justify using the full bonus.</p>

			<h7>Natural 20s and Fumbles with Skill Checks</h7>
			<p>When a PC rolls a natural 20 with a skill check, the GM should feel free to give that character much more success than the player expected.</p>
			<p>When a PC rolls a 1 with a skill check, the skill check fumbles and fails, perhaps, but not always, in a particularly dramatic way.</p>

			<h7>Fail Forward!</h7>
			<p>Outside of battle, when failure would tend to slow action down rather than move the action along, instead interpret it as a near-success or event that happens to carry unwanted consequences or side effects. The character probably still fails to achieve the desired goal, but that’s because something happens on the way to the goal rather than because nothing happens. In any case, the story and action still keep moving.</p>

			<h7>Background/Skill Advancement</h7>
			<p>All your skill checks increase by 1 when you level up. If you want even better skill checks, take the Further Backgrounding <a href="#feats">feat</a>.</p>
			<p>If you just want to move around the bonuses you already have to show how your character is changing, with the GM’s permission you can move one background point around among your current backgrounds each time you gain a level, or swap the point into an entirely new background.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="unique" class="tabcontent">
			<h3>Choose Your One Unique Thing</h3>
			<p>Your character’s One Unique Thing (their <i>unique</i>) is a special feature invented by you, the player, which sets your character apart from every other hero. It is a unique and special trait to your player, and markedly unusual. The intent is that it provides a special flavor to the campaign and can assist the GM in determining how your character can interact with characters and story in the campaign. Your character’s unique should not provide general practical value in combat. That is not the intent. The intent is to open up story arcs and fun roleplaying opportunities.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="combat-stats" class="tabcontent">
			<h3>Determine Your Combat Stats</h3>
			<p>For details on how combat works, see <a href="#combat">Combat Rules</a>.</p>

			<h7>Determine Your 1st Level Hit Points</h7>
			<ol>
				<li>Find your hitpoint value (HP value) in your class' stats chart.</li>
				<li>Add your Warrior attribtue.</li>
				<li>Multiply the total by 3 to get your total hit points at 1st level.</li>
			</ol>
			<h7>Determine Your Armor Class</h7>
			<ol>
				<li>Find the base AC value for your armor type (10, 12, 14, or 17) in the <a href="#equipment">equipment</a> section.</li>
				<li>If you are wearing light armor or no armor, add your Rogue attribute.</li>
				<li>If you are wearing medium armor, add +2 or your Rogue attribute, whichever is lower.</li>
				<li>If you are wielding a shield, add +1.</li>
				<li>Add +1 at 1st level (and increase by +1 at each additional level).</li>
			</ol>
			<h7>Determine Your Physical Defense</h7>
			<ol>
				<li>Start with a base of 10.</li>
				<li>Add any bonuses from your class' stats chart.</li>
				<li>Add your Warrior attribute.</li>
				<li>Add +1 at 1st level (and increase by +1 at each additional level).</li>
			</ol>
			<h7>Determine Your Mental Defense</h7>
			<ol>
				<li>Start with a base of 10.</li>
				<li>Add any bonuses from your class' stats chart.</li>
				<li>Add your Mage attribute.</li>
				<li>Add +1 at 1st level (and increase by +1 at each additional level).</li>
			</ol>
			<h7>Determine Your Initiative Bonus</h7>
			<p>Your initiative modifier is added to a d20 check, rather than existing as a static value</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Start with your Rogue attribute.</li>
				<li>Add +1 at 1st level (and increase by +1 at each additional level).</li>
			</ol>
			<h7>Determine Your Recoveries and Recovery Value</h7>
			<p>Most characters start the game with 8 recoveries. Some classes and talent choices may give you more recoveries. When you heal using a recovery, you heal hit points equal to one-quarter of your hit points (rounded down).</p>
			<h7>Determine Your Attacks and Powers</h7>
			<p>Each character has access to melee basic attack. Each character with a ranged weapon has access to a ranged basic attack. Basic attack damage dice are of a size determined by your weapon, and you roll a number of these dice equal to your level. Furthermore, you add a number to your damage with basic attacks equal to the attribute you used to make the attack multiplied by your tier (ex: Warrior x 1 at Adventurer tier, Warrior x 2 at Champion, and Warrior x 3 at Epic). Characters proficient in at least one martial weapon deal damage equal to their level on a miss with a melee basic attack, but not a ranged basic attack. Some talents will also allow characters to deal damage equal to their level on a miss with a melee basic attack despite not being proficient in martial weapons.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise specified, a basic attack looks something like this:</p>
			<div class="indent">
				<p>
				Melee <i>or</i> Ranged Attack<br/>
				At-Will<br/>
				<b>Attack:</b> Basic Attack Stat + Level vs. AC<br/>
				<b>Hit:</b> WEAPON (Level x Weapon Die) + Basic Attack Stat damage<br/>
				<b>Miss:</b> Damage equal to your level (Maybe).<br/>
				</p>
			</div>
			<p>You class determines which basic attribute you use for attack and damage rolls, what weapons you are considered proficient in (using a weapon you are not proficient in confers a -2 penalty to attack rolls), and what powers and feats you have access to. Unless your class specifies otherwise, you begin play at first level with two feats, and then gain one feat per additional level.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="icon" class="tabcontent">
			<h3>Assign Your Relationship Points</h3>
			<p>At 1st level, each character gets 3 relationship points. Each point represents one d6 to be used when trying to leverage your connection to the <a href="#icons">icon</a>.</p>
			<p>The number of points you invest in a relationship with an icon doesn’t necessarily correlate with the closeness of the connection or the strength of the relationship. It does correlate with the utility of the relationship. It’s not necessarily about how well the icon knows you or how strong the icon feels about you. Instead, the points reflect the chance that your relationship will be helpful to you.</p>
			<p>The Icon Relationships Chart summarizes the likely roleplaying and story-oriented consequences of positive, conflicted, and negative relationships with heroic, ambiguous, and villainous icons.</p>

			<h7>The Icon Relationships Chart</h7>
			<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" style="width: 100%">
				<tr>
					<th style="width: 10%">Icon</th>
					<th style="width: 30%">Positive Relationship</th>
					<th style="width: 30%">Conflicted Relationship</th>
					<th style="width: 30%">Negative Relationship</th>
				</tr>
				<tr class="odd-row">
					<th>Heroic Icon</th>
					<td>Spend 1, 2, or 3 points. As far as this icon is concerned, you’re one of the good guys, a white-hat hero. Authorities often help you, and civilians often trust you. On the down side, you may be called on to serve representatives of the icon even when you have other plans. You might also be a target of villainous icons or this heroic icon’s rivals.</td>
					<td>Spend 1, 2, or 3 points. You’re probably one of the good guys, but for some reason you’re suspect to the icon Maybe you’re a convict who has served his time, or an imperial soldier who was too good and got drummed out of his legion. You have insider knowledge and allies who are in good with the icon but you also have enemies associated with the icon.</td>
					<td>Spend 1 point. In the icon’s eyes, you’re a dissident, opponent, rival, or foe. You may have contacts or inside knowledge that you can use to your advantage, but some form of trouble waits for you wherever this heroic icon has influence.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Ambiguous Icon</th>
					<td>Spend 1, 2, or 3 points. Thanks to your relationship with the icon you are a hero to some, a villain to others, and possibly even a monster to a few. The enemies of your friends may turn out to be your friends, and vice versa. Advantages and complications will come from all sides.</td>
					<td>Spend 1, 2, or 3 points. Your relationship with the icon is complex, an uneven relationship with an icon who’s a hero to some and a villain to others. One way or another, you can find help or hostility anywhere. You don’t just live in interesting times—you create them.</td>
					<td>Spend 1 or 2 points. Your enmity with this icon makes you some enemies, but it also makes you some useful friends. You may be a dissenter, unwanted family member, or even a traitor in some way.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr class="odd-row">
					<th>Villanous Icon</th>
					<td>Spend 1 point. You are able to gain secrets or secretive allies, but your connection to this icon brings trouble from people associated with the heroic icons who oppose the villain. Be prepared to justify why you’re not imprisoned, interrogated, or otherwise harassed by the heroic icons and their representatives whenever they encounter you. Or for that matter, by the other PCs.</td>
					<td>Spend 1 or 2 points. You mostly work against the icon but you’re also connected to the icon in a way you can’t deny. Your connection sometimes gives you special knowledge or contacts, but it also makes you suspect in the eyes of many right-minded would-be heroes.</td>
					<td>Spend 1 or 2 points. You mostly work against the icon but you’re also connected to the icon in a way you can’t deny. Your connection sometimes gives you special knowledge or contacts, but it also makes you suspect in the eyes of many right-minded would-be heroes.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<h7>Rolling Icon Relationship Dice</h7>
			<p>To check your icon relationship (your relationship with a particular icon , roll a d6 for each point you have in the relationship. This means that you will usually roll 1, 2, or 3 dice. (At epic level, it may be 4.)</p>
			<p>If any die is a 6, you get some meaningful advantage from the relationship without having complications. If two or three dice come up 6, that’s even better.</p>
			<p>If any die is a 5, your connection to the icon is going to work out as well as a 6 would, but with some unexpected complication. If it’s a good icon you might be drawn into some obligation. If it’s a villainous icon, you might attract unwanted attention.</p>
			<p>Rolling 5s when you also rolled 6s should make life both interesting and advantageous!</p>

			<h7>Icons' Organizations</h7>
			<p>Icons are usually not directly part of the campaign. They rarely make an appearance personally, except perhaps at epic level. Most of the time, interacting with an icon means that you’re actually interacting with his or her lower-level functionaries, acolytes, disciples, bureaucrats, lieutenants, barons, priests, etc. In fact, any level of relationship with an icon can be enough to get you noticed by other people who are connected to that icon.</p>

			<h7>Using Your Icon Relationships</h7>
			<p>The most straightforward way to use your relationship points is on positive or conflicted connections that generally provide you with outright assistance and useful information.</p>
			<p>Negative relationships usually provide inside knowledge, special skills, opportunistic allies, and possibly some sort of supernatural advantage against a villain.</p>
			<p>Often you might find that enemies of your rival see you as an opportunity to strike against that mutual enemy. You might get help, wealth and resources, and even magic items from quite unexpected sources, some of which may not be entirely to your liking.</p>
			<p>In addition to aid from others, icon relationships provide characters with special knowledge.</p>
			<p>A negative relationship with a thoroughly villainous icon is more in keeping with the heroic lifestyle, but you should expect that the assistance you get from a negative relationship may end up being more directly confrontational than more conventional conflicted and positive relationships.</p>

			<h7>Changing Relatioships</h7>
			<p>When your character achieves champion tier (5th level), you gain an extra relationship point. Use it to increase an existing relationship by one die or gain a 1-point relationship with a new icon to match your character’s story thus far. You can save the extra relationship die and decide to apply it later.</p>
			<p>At 5th level, or any time thereafter, you can switch an existing relationship point from one icon to another, including to a new icon. You owe the GM and other players an entertaining explanation of what this big change represents for your character personally, of course.</p>
			<p>When you reach epic tier (8th level), you gain another relationship point, which you can use to increase an existing icon relationship by one die, including up to 1 point over maximum. As at 5th level, if switching a relationship point from one icon to another makes sense for your 8th level character, go for it.</p>
		</div>

			<h3>Flesh Out Your Character</h3>
			<h7>Choose a Race</h7>
			<p>Talk to your GM about what races are available in your setting. Your race has no direct mechanical impact outside of qualifying for heritage feats (see <a href="#feats">Feats</a>), but could be a significant part of your character depending on your backstory and the setting.</p>
