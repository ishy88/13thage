		<h1>Feats</h1>

		<p class="initial">Characters choose a feat at 1st level, and at every subsequent level. Humans choose an addition feat at 1st level.</p>
		<p>Feats appear in three tiers: adventurer feats, champion feats, and epic feats. Adventurer feats are available to any character between level 1 and level 10. Champion feats are available starting at level 5. Epic feats are available starting at level 8.</p>
		<p>Most of the feats in the game are attached to specific class talents, attacks, and spells. If a feat is attached to a talent, power, or spell, you must have the talent, power, or spell in order to choose the feat. When there is more than one feat attached to a specific talent or power, you have to choose the lower tier feats before you pick up the higher tier feats.</p>

		<h4>General Feats</h4>
		<p>These are general feats available to any character. A character can’t take a specific feat more than once. A few general feats only have adventurer-tier versions; others also have champion- and epic-tier versions that can be added later in your career.</p>

		<h7>Alien Mind</h7>
		<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Tier</i></b>: Once per battle when an enemy’s attack hits your MD, you can force the attacker to reroll the attack.</p>

		<h7>Bestial Wrath</h7>
		<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Tier</i></b>: Once per day when you are hit by an attack while staggered (even if the attack drops you to 0 hp or below) you can make a basic attack as a free action against the attacker.</p>
		<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Tier</i></b>: You no longer have to be staggered, but if you aren't then the attacker must be.</p>

		<h7>Blood Echo</h7>
		<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Tier</i></b>: Choose one racial power of another race. One battle per day, you can give up a use of your primary racial power to gain the use of this one.</p>
		<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Tier</i></b>: Two battles per day.</p>
		<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Tier</i></b>: Each battle.</p>

		<h7>Born To Battle</h7>
		<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Tier</i></b>: You may give up one of your class’ three talents to gain the use of two powers from another class at your level or lower.  You cannot exchange a talent for spells or talents. (For example, you can take the rogue’s flying blade and deadly thrust powers, but not the murderous or shadow walk talents.) You can use these powers as if you were a PC of that class at the same level. Any class requirements for using a power come with the talent. For example, if you take rogue powers that require momentum, your character uses momentum rules just as a rogue does. In addition, you may improve your choices by taking feats related to those powers up to your tier.</p>
		<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Tier</i></b>: Gain an additional power from the same class.</p>
		<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Tier</i></b>: Gain another power from the same class.</p>

		<h7>Elemental Endurance</h7>
		<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Tier</i></b>: You gain resistance 16+ to a single elemental damage type: fire, cold, lightning or thunder.</p>

		<h7>Fey Touch</h7>
		<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Tier</i></b>: Choose two wizard cantrips. Once per round, or once per minute out of battle, you can cast one of these cantrips (per the normal cantrip rules).</p>

		<h7>Fluid Identity</h7>
		<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Tier</i></b>: When making a skill check to disguise yourself as someone else, roll twice and use either result.</p>

		<h7>From Shadow To Shadow</h7>
		<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Tier</i></b>: Once per battle (or once per five minutes out of battle) as a quick action, you gain a +5 bonus to checks to hide that turn.</p>

		<h7>Further Backgrounding</h7>
		<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Tier</i></b>: Add a total of 2 points to backgrounds you already have, or choose 2 points of new backgrounds that make sense for your character. You still can’t go over the 5-point-per-background maximum.</p>
		<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Tier</i></b>: Add a total of 3 points to backgrounds you already have, or choose 3 points of new backgrounds that make sense for your character. You still can’t go over the 5-point-per-background maximum.</p>
		<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Tier</i></b>: Add a total of 2 points to backgrounds you already have, or choose 2 points of new backgrounds that make sense for your character. These points can take one of your backgrounds over 5, to a maximum of 7.</p>

		<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Tier</i></b>: You gain an additional +1 bonus to AC when wearing light armor or no armor.</p>
		<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Tier</i></b>: You gain another +1 bonus to AC when wearing light armor or no armor.</p>

		<h7>Legendary Scion</h7>
		<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Tier</i></b>: Once per day when you rally, you gain an additional use of your racial power that battle.</p>

		<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Tier</i></b>: This feat allows you to speak enough arcana, dwarven, elven, gnomish, gnoll, goblin, orcish, and other standard humanoid languages to comprehend enough of what most other humanoids are saying or screaming during battle. You are not fluent in all these languages, no one will mistake you for a native speaker, and your vocabulary is adventurer-centric (heavy on words connected to danger rather than philosophy or emotions). You can also read enough to get by in all these languages.</p>
		<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Tier</i></b>: You can speak, read, and write all the humanoid languages fluently. Stranger languages are no problem for you either. If someone is speaking it, you can figure it out.</p>

		<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Tier</i></b>: Increase your maximum hit points by 2 hit points per level. You also gain a +2 bonus to your third death save each battle, and a +2 bonus to saves against untyped ongoing damage.</p>
		<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Epic Tier</i></b>: The hit point bonus is now three times your current level. You also gain a +2 to your second death save each battle, and your saves to end ongoing untyped damage are now easy saves. (You still get the +2 bonus from the Champion Tier feat.)</p>

		<h7>Nature’s Arsenal</h7>
		<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Tier</i></b>: Your unarmed melee attacks do 1d6 damage plus any applicable modifiers. If you are wielding a weapon in one hand, you are considered to be wielding a weapon in your other hand as well.</p>
		<p class="feat"><b><i>Champion Tier</i></b>: When your natural melee attack roll equals the number currently showing on the escalation die, you can make an immediate basic unarmed melee attack against the same enemy as a free action.</p>

		<h7>Otherwordly Strike</h7>

		<h7>Precise Shot</h7>
		<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Tier</i></b>: When your ranged attack targets an enemy who is engaged with an ally, you have no chance of hitting that ally.</p>

		<h7>Purpose Over Pain</h7>
		<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Tier</i></b>: You may take damage equal to twice your level to ignore (not end) one dazed, hampered, or weakened condition until the end of your turn.</p>

		<h7>Rapid Reload</h7>
		<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Tier</i></b>: Reloading a heavy crossbow now takes only a quick action. Reloading a hand or light crossbow is a free action.</p>

At 5th level, the total hp bonus increases to your baseline hp value. At 8th level, the total hp bonus increases to double your baseline hp value.</p>

		<h7>Uncanny Resilience</h7>
		<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Tier</i></b>: Once per day when you are hit by an attack, you can choose to take half damage from the attack.</p>

		<h7>Underworld Senses</h7>
		<p class="odd-row feat"><b><i>Adventurer Tier</i></b>: Each time you attack or are attacked by an invisible enemy, roll a hard save (16+). On a success, that enemy isn’t invisible to you during your next turn.</p>
