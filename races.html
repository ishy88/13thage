		<h1>Character Races</h1>

		<p class="initial">The standard races in 13th Age are <a href=#dwarf">Dwarf</a>, <a href="#gnome">Gnome</a>, <a href="#half-elf">Half-Elf</a>, <a href="#halfling">Halfling</a>, <a href="#high-elf">High Elf</a>, <a href="#human">Human</a>, <a href="#lizardfolk">Lizardfolk</a>, <a href="#orc">Orc</a>, and <a href="#wood-elf">Wood Elf</a>.</p>
		<p>A variety of cultures and societies populate the world of 13th Age, some made up of humans but others made up of fantastic races such as elves, dwarves, and halflings. Adventurers and heroes can arise from these various peoples. Your choice of character race provides you with a basic set of advantages and special abilities. If you’re a fighter, are you a stubborn dwarf monster-slayer, a graceful elf blademaster, or a fierce lizardfolk gladiator? If you’re a wizard, are you a brave human spell-for-hire or a devious gnome conjurer? Your character race not only affects your powers but also provides the first cues for building your character’s story.</p>
