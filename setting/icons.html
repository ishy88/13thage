			<h3>Icons</h3>
			<p>An icon is a powerful NPC (non-playable character) that has a strong influence on the world outside the scope of the campaign, yet may indeed aid or oppose your character over the course of the campaign, depending on the relationship your character has with the icon.</p>
			<p>Icons have their own story, alignment, and personality. The general knowledge and history about them may vary in depth and accuracy; they may be well-known or mysterious. They have their own relationships with other icons, too, which may be friendly, tolerable, or acrimonious.</p>
			<p>Your character may have relationships with certain icons. This relationship, if it exists, can be positive, conflicted, or negative.</p>

			<p><b>The Archmage</b> is an appointment for life, bestowed only to the wisest and most powerful mage in the Empire. Or whichever one manages to best buy the arcane councils support. Although nominally in charge of arcane univerisities across the Empire, the current Archmage has mostly withdrawn from society over the last decade. He is said to be preparing a spell so powerful it would change the nature of the world istelf.</p>

			<p><b>The Crusader</b> is the armored fist of the Dark Gods. Those he commands operate on the edges of the Empire, seeking out and destroying demons and their pawns. So long as the Empire and the Gods of Light don't interfere, that is where their focus shall stay.</p>

			<p><b>The Diabolist</b> controls fiends and tampers with forces even the Archmage avoids. She likes her victims screaming and her chaos pure while claiming that the demons she summons would otherwise overwhelm the Great Gold Wyrm who defends the world from the Abyss. There are two differences between her and her demons: First, she likes keeping destruction personal rather than universal. Second, she’s capable of kindness, so long as it comes as a great surprise.</p>

			<p><b>The Dwarf King</b> is a vestige of a fallen empire. There was a time when the dwarves lived in halls set with gems and gold, when they were the undisputed masters of the Spear of Ath'un. Now, though, the Dwarf King rules over scattered clans of refugees. The Empire pays him lip service, but little else so long as he withholds the truth of what happened to his people.</p>

			<p><b>The Elf Queen</b> rules the untamed wilds of the north. Her people are the wood elves, nomads, following the migrations of the mammoth. Though they trade and sometimes even interbreed with the humans of the Empire, they are not trusted. Her magic is said to rival that of the archmage, and that knowledge sets those who see pointed ears at unease.</p>

			<p><b>The Emperor</b> rules the world’s greatest human kingdom, known as the Empire of Gold for the rich mines that funded its expansion. All the signs suggest that the age is turning, but will the Empire fall or shift to a new balance?</p>

			<p><b>The Great Gold Wyrm</b> is the legendary beast that carves a path across the sky each day, bringing light to the world. Cults around the Wyrm are abundant across the empire, and there are murmurs among them that Garm Wellfinger, the first man to come back from the far east, is an avatar of the Wyrm himself. For what purpose the Wyrm has sent one of His avatars to earth, they cannot say.</p>

			<p><b>The High Druid</b> is the champion of the resurgent Wild, and the spiritual and magical leader of spirits of nature and the elements that were chained by the Empire but are now working themselves free. She might be the great force that shakes the Empire to pieces or the hero who destroys the destroyers and points to a new way to live.</p>

			<p><b>The Lich King</b> rules an island nation in the Sunrise Sea where undeath is simply a fact of life. His people are the high elves, and they long ago mastered the art of preforming necromancy without forfeiting one's soul. It is not unusual to visit Khain&eacute; and see a zombie-powered palanquin or a skeleton sweeping a stoop. They are a secretive people when it counts, however, deeply mistrustful of outside religions and extremely protective of the secrets of lichdom.</p>

			<p><b>The Orc Lord</b> is a figure of legend. A tale that parents would tell their children to keep them in bed at night. Imagine the surprise of the citizens when he turned out to be real. He rules the steppes beyond the Spear of Ath'un, his people are shepherds and hunters. So far it seems that tales of his ferocity were greatly exagerrated. But then again, those stories must have come from somewhere.</p>

			<p><b>The Priestess</b> hears all the Gods of Light and speaks for those who please her. She is part oracle, part mystic, and part metaphysical engineer, since she created the Cathedral, an ever-expanding temple with rooms or entire wings for each of the faiths she favors.</p>

			<p><b>The Prince of Shadows</b> is part thief, part trickster, and part assassin. To some he is a hero; to others a villain. He has squandered the stars from the sky, murdered the hopes of a king, and plundered the dreams of a god. His exploits have changed the world, but none can tell you his ultimate goals or motives.</p>

			<p><b>The Three</b> were among the first dragons to walk the world. While the High Druid ultimately stands for harmony with nature, the Three want civilization snuffed out beneath their feet. The Red is a creature of flame and molten stone, a living engine of destruction. The Blue is said to have the powers of an oracle, her messengers in every gust and rain. The Black is master of disease, death, and darkness, it is said it was he who claims the souls of those who dabble in necromancy without the proper precautions. Why the Three work together is not clear, some say they are siblings, others say lovers, but all say to stay far, far away.</p>

			<h2>Archmage</h2>
			<p class="initial subtitle">"Ah, just step over the runes on the floor there. They're harmless. Mostly"</p>
			<p>The Archmage is an appointment for life, bestowed only to the wisest and most powerful mage in the Empire. Or whichever one manages to best buy the arcane councils support. Although nominally in charge of arcane univerisities across the Empire, the current Archmage has mostly withdrawn from society over the last decade. He is said to be preparing a spell so powerful it would change the nature of the world istelf.</p>
			<p><b>Usual Location</b>: In Horizon, or (rumor has it) peering out through the eyes of one of his homunculi.</p>
			<p><b>Common Knowledge</b>: For hundreds of years, one constant has been present on the Emperor's high council&mdash;the Archmage. While an everyday wizard works magic that can astound or destroy a crowd, the Archmage casts spells that quiet storms, enliven crops, and stave off plague. The Empire has experienced a steady growth in order, security, and wealth, largely because the Archmage wards off chaos, peril, and calamity.<br/>
			&emsp;The Archmage’s plans and projects are beyond the ken of normal people, but even normal people are part of his schemes. The Empire’s farms plant different crops at different times, all coordinated by the Archmage’s schedule. Merchants and travelers consult the Archmage’s almanacs to find the best times to set sail. But the common people have little appreciation for what the Archmage does for them. People even complain about the Archmage’s instructions, as if he were a capricious bureaucrat in the imperial offices.<br/>
			&emsp;The Archmage maintains the wards that protect the Empire through a series of magical nodes, placed at strategic points across the land. The nodes tap into ley lines, which occur naturally (although the imperial ley lines are better controlled and more powerful) and channel and direct arcane energy from them to the wards.<br/>
			&emsp;The Archmage oversees the University of Imperial Wizardry, though it is run day-to-day by several of his trusted inner circle members. This school devotes itself to testing and training those with arcane potential. The imperial wizards are notorious for being tight-lipped about their true intentions, and they lie without compunction to cover their tracks. No one holds it against them; however mad he may be, the Archmage knows best.</p>
			<p><b>Adventurers and the Archmage</b>: Many adventurers long to be hired into the Archmage’s service. His wizards provide powerful arcane support, and they reward adventurers well, but the Archmage’s missions are notoriously obscure. Instead of killing monsters or rescuing damsels, adventurers hired by imperial wizards may find themselves burying ritual items in wastelands or painting sigils on the walls of ruins. Somehow, it’s all very important to the empire. The less-known truth is that the Archmage is losing his handle on the multitude of tasks he has taken responsibility for and is forced to trust more and more missions to adventurers and agents while he struggles to deal with the high arcana that only he can survive.</p>
			<p><b>Allies</b>: The Archmage swears undying fealty to the Emperor. There are legends of past Archmages who have betrayed their imperial oaths, and those legends always end poorly for all concerned. The Archmage and the Priestess, as fellow champions of the Empire, are bound to work together toward common goals. Some say that high-order goals are all the two icons have in common and that they are never seen together at Imperial functions. Others say that they cooperate more than anyone knows and that the Archmage even helped the Priestess build the Cathedral.</p>
			<p><b>Enemies</b>: Nature, like the High Druid, chafes at the bit that the Archmage has jammed into its mouth. If the Archmage is the enemy of nature, he is careful not to raise the Elf Queen’s ire. The Archmage respects the boundaries of the Elf Queen’s territory. The Lich King is another matter, as no one seems more ditrustful of the someposedly safe practices of the high elves than the Archmage.</p>
			<p><b>History</b>: As often as not, no mortal is worthy to claim the title of Archmage. An Archmage’s appointment is for life, their reign lasting for decades or centuries. Eras in which there is an Archmage tend to be times of growth and recovery, though sometimes an Archmage appears in order to prevent the lands from descending into chaos. The current Archmage has been in power for centuries, overseeing a gradual increase in general security and prosperity.</p>
			<p><b>The True Danger</b>: Everything will be all right provided that no catastrophe brings down the Archmage’s power nodes and plunges the Empire into a maelstrom of rampant elementals, natural forces, monsters from the Starfall Sea, and demons from the Abyss.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="crusader" class="tabcontent">
			<h2>Crusader</h2>
			<p class="initial subtitle">"Get the hell out of my way."</p>
			<p>The Crusader is the armored fist of the Dark Gods. Those he commands operate on the edges of the Empire, seeking out and destroying demons and their pawns. So long as the Empire and the Gods of Light don't interfere, that is where their focus shall stay.</p>
			<p><b>Usual Location</b>: First Triumph, a fortress built above the abyssal rift nearest Horizon. Or out Crusading.</p>
			<p><b>Common Knowledge</b>: One way or another, it’s a bad sign that the Crusader is accommodated within the Empire and sometimes even welcomed. It means either that the common people have lost their good sense or that times are so dire that the people will accept the help of a destroyer bound to the Dark Gods.<br/>
			&emsp;If the enemy of your enemy is your friend, then the Crusader is everybody’s friend because demons are everybody’s enemy. The Crusader, however, is the sort of friend who will burn your house to the ground if he finds it tactically necessary.<br/>
			&emsp;The mighty deeds of the Crusader include conquering abyssal rifts and making them his own. The first rift he conquered was an especially large and perverted one near the Imperial capital, Horizon. It was there that he established his headquarters, known as First Triumph. When he conquers a rift, he binds the defeated demons and forces them to garrison the fort he builds or claims at the location. There are many who think him exceedingly foolish for toying with demons like this.<br/>
			&emsp;The Crusader leads an elite corps of ruthless warriors, spellcasters, and assassins. From him, they learn the lost ways of the Dark Gods, speaking oaths long forbidden to those who walk in the light of day. Critics of the Crusader say that the side effect of this training is to burn all pity and love from the hearts of the crusaders, and indeed a pitiless heart is not a side effect but the very point of the training. Many crusader initiates prove unworthy of the challenge. Those who die in training are perhaps luckier than those who live on, forever haunted by what they learned but failed to master.</p>
			<p><b>Adventurers & the Crusader</b>: For an adventurer to have undertaken missions sponsored by the Crusader is a cause for bragging rights. Such missions are never mere cakewalks or uneventful garrison duty. The Crusader has stepped on certain toes, and his personal style is unacceptable to certain hosts, so he occasionally hires adventurers from outside his organization to undertake missions in “hostile” territory, such as near the Priestess’s Cathedral on Isla Perla or in the vicinity of the Golden Citadel.</p>
			<p><b>Allies</b>: The Crusader acknowledges the Emperor as the ruler of the land, though some suspect that he would just as soon acknowledge the Elf Queen or the Lich King as such.</p>
			<p><b>Enemies</b>: If the Diabolist fears the Crusader, and she probably should, then he’s the only thing in all the worlds that she fears. The Priestess works to protect people from the excesses of the Crusader, to the point of hindering his efforts. The bitter rivalry between the Crusader and the cults of the Great Gold Wyrm lacks any formal declaration, but it is as thick as ochre jelly.</p>
			<p><b>History</b>: The history books include accounts of imperial champions, but never a hero as dark and forbidding as the Crusader. He might be a new icon, or a recurrent hero icon that has somehow woke up on the dark side of the banner.</p>
			<p><b>The True Danger</b>: Everything will be all right provided the demons keep the Crusader busy and he has no time to pay attention to second priorities, such as stomping on the face of goodness and light.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="diabolist" class="tabcontent">
			<h2>Diabolist</h2>
			<p class="initial subtitle">“Why do you mortals take these blood feuds so seriously? Don’t you see it’s all just a game? Don’t you realize that I’ve already won?”</p>
			<p>The Diabolist controls fiends and tampers with forces even the Archmage avoids. She likes her victims screaming and her chaos pure while claiming that the demons she summons would otherwise overwhelm the Great Gold Wyrm who defends the world from the Abyss. There are two differences between her and her demons: First, she likes keeping destruction personal rather than universal. Second, she’s capable of kindness, so long as it comes as a great surprise.</p>
			<p><b>Usual Location</b>: She is said to live in Hell Marsh, far beyond the reaches of the empire in an abyssal rift rife with ungodly flowers.</p>
			<p><b>Common Knowledge</b>: The longer she lives, the more this Diabolist looks like one of her demons. The stories are that she was originally a human woman, but you’d be hard-pressed to prove it.<br/>
			&emsp;If the Diabolist has overarching goals, they are obscure. What’s clear is the delight she takes in wielding power and unleashing chaos. Her enemies say that she may be nothing more than a slave to the vast powers she dares to command, but as long as she’s smiling she seems to have the upper hand.<br/>
			&emsp;The Diabolist leads a scattered and half-mad crew of fiendish cultists. They adore her with respect that borders on worship. In turn, she alternately exalts them and brings them to ruin. With her help, they learn occult secrets, master unspeakable magic, and gloat over the destruction of their enemies. No cultist knows the extent of the cult or its ultimate goals. It is certainly more widespread than the imperial authorities admit to publicly.<br/>
			&emsp;The Diabolist lacks the focus and discipline that define the Crusader. She is in it for herself, and she indulges even her petty whims. If she remained on-task the way the Crusader does, things would doubtless be a lot worse. Unless indulging her whims is actually part of a subtle plot that none can guess at until it is too late.</p>
			<p><b>Adventurers and the Diabolist</b>: Too many adventurers accept missions on the Diabolist’s behalf, often because they are reckless. If adventurers knew what was best for them, they would probably have chosen safer careers than adventuring. Still, a few lucky adventurers have profited mightily from her sponsorship, and they love to show off the remarkable weapons and talismans that they have acquired in consideration for their services.<br/>
			&emsp;Adventurers who work for the Diabolist for long suspect that her chaotic whims and petty vendettas are cover for howling insanity. There are ranks of fiendish cultists hidden behind the gloating cultists who are easy to spot and kill. The deeper you go the more disturbing and insane the experience becomes.</p>
			<p><b>Allies</b>: The Diabolist and the Prince of Shadows are said to work together. Everyone else hopes they’re going to betray each other. They hope that a lot.</p>
			<p><b>Enemies</b>: The Crusader is the Diabolist’s worst nightmare, and she’s no big fan of the cults of the Great Gold Wyrm, either. The Priestess protects good people from corruption, making her a real annoyance as well.</p>
			<p><b>History</b>: It seems there’s always a Diabolist or at least someone who claims the title. Each of these twisted villains has been different from the ones that came before them. Embracing chaos amplifies a mortal’s personal traits, making each Diabolist unique. Usually a Diabolist is something of a rumor and a mystery, more a legend than a force to be reckoned with. Unfortunately, the current Diabolist has proven herself to be much more than a story to frighten children with.</p>
			<p><b>The True Danger</b>: Everything will be all right provided that the Diabolist remains unable to corrupt the Emperor or other icons.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="dwarfking" class="tabcontent">
			<h2>Dwarf King</h2>
			<p class="initial subtitle">"In the name of the Ancestors of Adamant, I accept the return of these stolen dwarven treasures.”</p>
			<p>The Dwarf King is a vestige of a fallen empire. There was a time when the dwarves lived in halls set with gems and gold, when they were the undisputed masters of the Spear of Ath'un. Now, though, the Dwarf King rules over scattered clans of refugees. The Empire pays him lip service, but little else so long as he withholds the truth of what happened to his people.</p>
			<p><b>Usual Location</b>: In his modest home in Horizon, or in one of the city's many taverns, drinking himself into a stupor.</p>
			<p><b>Common Knowledge</b>: The Dwarf King is the master of treasures, pressing a claim on all marvels pulled from the earth. His halls were filled with legendary marvels. As the Emperor ruled the civilized lands above, the Dwarf King ruled the civilized lands below. Until the day the dwarves appeared on the eastern shore of the Empire, begging for refuge. If any besides the Dwarf King himself know what drove them from their mountain homes, they aren't talking.</p>
			<p><b>Adventurers & the Dwarf King</b>: The Dwarf King has the means and the cause to hire mercenaries to represent his interests or retrieve items that the dwarves lay claim to, whether on the surface world or deep underground. He rarely does anymore, but several of his more optimistic advisors continue to try and rebuild the Dwarven Kingdom in his stead.</p>
			<p><b>Allies</b>: The Dwarf King works reliably with the Emperor, and he respects the ages-old truce with the Lich King.</p>
			<p><b>Enemies</b>: When the Orc Lord's hordes get out of hand, they are the worst sort of enemy. The Dwarf King has offered a king’s ransom for the head of the Prince of Shadows.</p>
			<p><b>History</b>: There is always a Dwarf King. This one has been in place for centuries, but no one would be surprised if he was found dead of drink tomorrow.</p>
			<p><b>The True Danger</b>: Everything will be all right provided whatever came for the dwarves comes no further.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="elfqueen" class="tabcontent">
			<h2>Elf Queen</h2>
			<p class="initial subtitle">"Use every part of your kill. Show the beast who gave us its life the same respect you would a cherished elder."</p>
			<p>The Elf Queen rules the untamed wilds of the north. Her people are the wood elves, nomads, following the migrations of the mammoth. Though they trade and sometimes even interbreed with the humans of the Empire, they are not trusted. Her magic is said to rival that of the archmage, and that knowledge sets those who see pointed ears at unease.</p>
			<p><b>Usual Location</b>: Somewhere in Turinqui Nanda, the vast land of steppes and woods between the Empire and the Sea of Endings.</p>
			<p>Common Knowledge</b>: The Queen is mystically connected to every wood elf, and so every wood elf is mystically connected to each of their kin.</p>
			<p><b>Adventurers & the Elf Queen</b>: Wood elf adventurers consider it an honor to work for the Queen, and non-elf adventurers consider it something of a miracle. Wood elf adventurers may find themselves guided by the Queen’s dream sendings to join the perilous adventures of other elves who need their help.</p>
			<p><b>Allies</b>: The High Druid is figuratively her half-sister of the woods. The Emperor is a trusted ally, but the Emperor’s Priestess and Archmage can be wearisome.</p>
			<p><b>Enemies</b>: The Lich King and the Elf Queen have a bitter rivalry spanning centuries, but what caused this schism is not widely know. The Three resent the Queen for imprisoning the White.</p>
			<p><b>History</b>: There is always an Elf King or Queen, though sometimes they are hidden and unknown. The current Queen has ruled for most of the current age.</p>
			<p><b>The True Danger</b>: Everything will be all right so long as the more barbaric residents of the north stay out of favor with the Queen, so that the Elf Queen sees little reason to exact bloody vengeances for ancient slights remembered only by the elves.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="emperor" class="tabcontent">
			<h2>Emperor</h2>
			<p class="initial subtitle">"As long as I draw breath, the Empire is safe"</p>
			<p>rules the world’s greatest human kingdom, known as the Empire of Gold for the rich mines that funded its expansion. All the signs suggest that the age is turning, but will the Empire fall or shift to a new balance?</p>
			<p><b>Usual Location</b>: Horizon, the capital of the Empire of Gold.</p>
			<p><b>Common Knowledge</b>: The Golden Emperor hails from a long line of noble rulers. It is his nature to lead. To the civilized people, he is the champion of their safety and prosperity.</p>
			<p><b>Adventurers & the Emperor</b>: Adventurers are routinely hired by imperial functionaries to carry out all manner of ad hoc missions. Adventurers who work exclusively for the Emperor are rewarded with increased pay and greater status, though other adventurers are likely to label them as imperial functionaries.</p>
			<p><b>Allies</b>: The Archmage and Priestess work closely with the Emperor. The Crusader ostensibly is duty-bound to the Emperor, but he interprets that duty as he sees fit. The Elf Queen, and Lich King are united with the Emperor in pursuit of peace and security.</p>
			<p><b>Enemies</b>: Murmurs among the dwarves suggest that the Dwarf King may be planning to retake his kingdom's former glory. The Orc Lord, though at peace with the Empire now, would wreak great havoc should he ever decide to cross the Sunrise sea.</p>
			<p><b>History</b>: Ever since the first Dragon Emperor established the Imperial Seal, there has always been a Dragon Emperor. Elaborate and exacting ceremonies ensure that the power and authority of the original Emperor live on. The current Emperor is capable but essentially unproven.</p>
			<p><b>The True Danger</b>: Everything will be all right as long as the Emperor stands stalwart between civilization and chaos.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="goldwyrm" class="tabcontent">
			<h2>Gold Wyrm</h2>
			<p class="initial subtitle">"If you fail me now, then my own sacrifice is also futile."</p>
			<p>The Great Gold Wyrm is the legendary beast that carves a path across the sky each day, bringing light to the world. Cults around the Wyrm are abundant across the empire, and there are murmurs among them that Garm Wellfinger, the first man to come back from the far east, is an avatar of the Wyrm himself. For what purpose the Wyrm has sent one of His avatars to earth, they cannot say.</p>
			<p><b>Usual Location</b>: Centuries ago, the Great Gold Wyrm threw itself into the Abyss to prevent the demons of hell from pouring out into the world. The Wyrm’s physical presence and his magical wards are still all that prevents the Abyss from ripping the world wide open. While his physical body still battles deep in the abyss, his spirit crosses the sky each day, patrolling around the world.</p>
			<p><b>Common Knowledge</b>: The best and bravest hear the Great Gold Wyrm’s call or receive his visions. They enter into his service as an elite champion, usually but not always as a member of the Golden Order.<br/>
			&emsp;In recent years, the Golden Order has fallen out of favor among the common folk, as many flock to Garm Wellfinger to hear his teachings, supposedly the words of the Wyrm himself. The Golden Order has officially renounced his claims that he is an incarnation of the Wyrm, but their cries fall mostly on deaf ears.</p>
			<p><b>Adventurers & the Gold Wyrm</b>: Various orders of paladins and clerics draw inspiration and power from the Great Gold Wyrm, as do mystically chosen individual heroes. In turn, these orders have been known to hire adventuring bands for special purposes.</p>
			<p><b>Allies</b>: The Golden Order pays lip service to the Golden Empire and its Emperor, but their main concerns are mostly beyond the scope of the Empire.</p>
			<p><b>Enemies</b>: The Wyrm’s principal enemies are the Diabolist and the Three. Both conflicts have mythical overtones, and like all true myths, there are moments when the great enemies have worked together, such as when the Red Dragon eliminated the demons that had escaped the Abyss, an act of violence that created the Red Wastes.</p>
			<p><b>History</b>: There has only ever been one Great Gold Wyrm, from the days when the gods made all the worlds to this very day. And some would say that there’s not much of the Great Gold Wyrm left.</p>
			<p><b>The True Danger</b>: Everything will be all right unless the Great Gold Wyrm finally loses his battle and the Abyss opens to swallow the world.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="highdruid" class="tabcontent">
			<h2>High Druid</h2>
			<p class="initial subtitle">"There’s a place for your roads and your cities: hunched tight to the shores of that fangless thing you still call a sea."</p>
			<p>The High Druid is the champion of the resurgent Wild, and the spiritual and magical leader of spirits of nature and the elements that were chained by the Empire but are now working themselves free. She might be the great force that shakes the Empire to pieces or the hero who destroys the destroyers and points to a new way to live.</p>
			<p><b>Usual Location</b>: For the first time in ages, the High Druid has established her environs within the bounds of the Empire, in the Wild Wood near New Port and Isla Perla.</p>
			<p><b>Common Knowledge</b>: The High Druid conducts sacred rituals from the age before the gods or the worlds. With these rituals, she calls up the mighty powers of nature. Druids everywhere, in turn, gain this power through allegiance to her.<br/>
			&emsp;It has been a long time since there was a High Druid who lived anywhere near the Empire. So far as anyone knows, the Druids have been strongest far to the North. But this new High Druid, a young half-elf woman, was born in the Empire and has turned the Wild Wood into her place of power. Her influence is being felt in all the other wild spaces, with effects ranging from increased growth of impassable forest to vastly increased amounts of game in the forests, schools of fish in the Sunrise Sea, and flocks of birds migrating across the land. Even Imperial officers admit that the High Druid’s influence seems to make the Empire’s lands in the region around Wild Wood healthier. Of course, they are also rightly concerned that it’s a region that would not mind shaking off the Empire’s cities, farms, and crowns.</p>
			<p><b>Adventurers & the High Druid</b>: Many rangers and druids have a relationship, one way or the other, with the High Druid. The High Druid herself may or may not be sending agents into the field. Certainly various high-power druids who respect the High Druid are using resurgence in wild power to pursue their own conflicting agendas. Some of these powerful druids have hired adventurers, and others have responded by hiring adventurers to destroy their rivals’ hirelings.</p>
			<p><b>Allies</b>: The High Druid is a force unto herself. She is figuratively half-sister of the Elf Queen, but there’s more sibling rivalry than love.</p>
			<p><b>Enemies</b>: The High Druid challenges the Emperor’s authority in the territory she has colonized. The Archmage has been restraining the tempestuous forces of nature to protect civilization, and the High Druid can feel it in her bones.</p>
			<p><b>History</b>: There usually is a High Druid. Sometimes there are two, but not for long. The High Druid’s affairs mostly concern the wilds, and civilized people know little about them.</p>
			<p><b>The True Danger</b>: Everything will be all right unless the Emperor and the High Druid truly go to war.</p>

			<h2>Lich King</h2>
			<p class="initial subtitle">"You may hate me all you wish, my people will see your bones cumble away to dust."</p>
			<p>The Lich King rules an island nation in the Sunrise Sea where undeath is simply a fact of life. His people are the high elves, and they long ago mastered the art of preforming necromancy without forfeiting one's soul. It is not unusual to visit Khain&eacute; and see a zombie-powered palanquin or a skeleton sweeping a stoop. They are a secretive people when it counts, however, deeply mistrustful of outside religions and extremely protective of the secrets of lichdom.</p>
			<p><b>Usual Location</b>: On Khain&eacute;, an island in the Sunrise Sea.</p>
			<p><b>Common Knowledge</b>: Not much is known of the Lich King. To those not born of the High Elves, his name, his past, who he was in life is lost to the ages. Common folk in the Empire revile him, sensibly frightened of the death and decay he represents, but those with more between their ears view the Lich King and his kingdom with more of a morbid curiosity.</p>
			<p><b>Adventurers & the Lich King</b>: The high elves occasionally hire adventurers to represent their will in the world at large, but their society does not turn to this option often, preferring to send representatives of their Undying Court instead.</p>
			<p><b>Allies</b>: Ostensibly, the Dwarf King and the Emperor, as an uneasy truce has bound their kingdoms together for centuries. In practice, few help the Lich King when they can avoid it.</p>
			<p><b>Enemies</b>: The Priestess and the High Druid see the undead of Khain&eacute; as an abomination against nature. The Elf Queen, while not diametrically opposed to her highblooded cousins, definitely does not lose any love of them.</p>
			<p><b>History</b>: There has only ever been one Lich King, the current one.</p> 
			<p><b>The True Danger</b>: As long as the Empire leaves the Lich King's island kingdom well alone, undead will stay off the Empire's shores.</p>

			<h2>Orc Lord</h2>
			<p class="initial subtitle">"Rest is death to us, and arson is our call to war."</p>
			<p>The Orc Lord is a figure of legend. A tale that parents would tell their children to keep them in bed at night. Imagine the surprise of the citizens when he turned out to be real. He rules the steppes beyond the Spear of Ath'un, his people are shepherds and hunters. So far it seems that tales of his ferocity were greatly exagerrated. But then again, those stories must have come from somewhere.</p>
			<p><b>Usual Location</b>: On the steppes to the East of the Spear of Ath'un.</p>
			<p><b>Common Knowledge</b>: The Orcs were never thought to be real, goblinkind.</p>
			<p><b>Adventurers & the Orc Lord</b>: Orcish
