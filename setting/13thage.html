		<p class="initial">&emsp;For as long as there has been an emperor on the Golden Throne, the known world has had hard limits: The Endlands to the north, the mountains forming the Spear of Ath'un to the east, and the twin Seas of Sunrise and Starfall to the south and west. In all recorded history of the races of men and elves not a single one of the countless many who tried to test these borders had ever returned. In seedy taverns and the cloistered chambers of noblemen alike there have been whispers that the dwarves of the Spear of Ath'un know what lies beyond, but these reports have never been confirmed. The dwarves, of course, deny any such allegations.</p>
    <p>&emsp;So it went, for 12 long Ages of the Great Gold Wyrm's dance across the sky. Mythical heroes passed into legend, as did the monsters they made their fame figting, wars were fought, kingdoms rose fell, and the ever-expanding line of Dragon Emperors slowly painted the map of the known world gold. The world has never been peaceful or stable, but it has always been reognized as an immutable truth that there is nothing beyond the edges of the maps.</p>
    <p>&emsp;Things changed at the Dawn of the 13th Age. Some twenty years before the 13th Age began a man by the name of Garm Wellfinger sent messenger pigeons across the empire requesting brave souls to join him on a journey across the Sunrise Sea and beyond the Spear of Ath'un. This venture was the talk of balls and feats for a matter of months, as it proved impossible to find anyone who had actually heard of this man before, much less someone who could forward an explanation for the small fortune he was using to fund his expedition. However, before long the name Garm Wellfinger faded from the public eye. He was, at the end of the day, a wealthy man with a few marbles missing, and it wasn't anyone else's business if he wanted to throw away his gold. Or his life.</p>
    <p>&emsp;Twenty years later, to the day, a man claiming to be Garm Wellfinger arrived in Ravensport from along the east road. With him he carried all manner of oddities and treasures. Strange fruit that tasted like rays of sunlight, weapons formed from metals that even the most skilled dwarven smiths could not identify, piles of pelts and feathers of never-before-seen creatures, tomes of incomprehensible runes written in none of the languages of men, and a stone of soft gold that he said was able to grant its holder anything their heart desired.</p>
    <p>&emsp;Not a month later, the first expeditions to the east were setting off, hundreds of young men and women deciding that they'd make their fortune in the jungles and ruins Garm had claimed to find in abundance beyond the edge of the empire. But while many were heading east, the dwarves of the Spear began a great migration west, into the borders of the empire. They offered no explanation, simply assuming that the emperor would accept their refugees. The only words on the lips of those dwarves who weren't just as confused as their human counterparts were those of warning. The east was empty, and further expeditions would only bring ruin unto the entire empire. The young, of course, are deaf to the voices of their elders, and many sallied forth regardless.</p>
    <p>&emsp;None have been able to replicate the success of Garm Wellfinger, although treasures of all sorts and shapes have been brought back from the vast steppes and dense jungles beyond the Spear. The influx of treasure seekers has died down some since the 13th Age began, but a fair number of aspiring dungeon-delvers still cast themselves out into the wilds in search of gold and glory every spring. You, adventurer, are one of these brave souls. What do you hope to find out there? What will you do if whatever took those heroes of yore finds you?</p>
